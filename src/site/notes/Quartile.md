# [[Quartile\|Quartile]]

Quartiles are special [[Percentile\|percentiles]]: the 1st quartile, $Q_{1}$, is equal to the 25th percentile; the 3rd quartile, $q_{3}$, is equal to the 75th percentile. The [[Median\|Median]] is both the 2nd quartile ($Q_{2}$) and the 50th [[Percentile\|Percentile]].

To calculate quartiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest.

```ad-Definizione
title: Quartile

**Quartiles** divide ordered data into *quarters*.

There are 4 quartiles:
- [[#1st Quartile]]
- [[#2nd Quartile]]
- [[#3rd Quartile]]
- [[#4th Quartile]]

```

A useful value is the [[Interquartile Range\|Interquartile Range]] (IQR).

## 1st Quartile


## 2nd Quartile

The 2nd quartile is also known as [[Median\|Median]]:

# [[Median\|Median]]

Median is a number that measures the center of the data. It can be thought of as the *middle value*, but is not necessarily one of the observed values. 

It separates ordered data into halves.

```ad-Definizione
title: Median

The **Median** is the value of a sample $X$ such that the probability of getting a value less than the median is equal to the prbability of getting a value greater than the median and is equal to 0.5.
- 50% of the observations are less than the median
- 50% of the observations are more than the median
