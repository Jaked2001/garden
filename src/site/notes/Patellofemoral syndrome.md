```ad-Definizione
title: PAtellofemoral pain syndrome

**Patellofemoral pain syndrome** (**PFPS**; not to be confused with jumper's knee) is [knee pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pain "Knee pain") as a result of problems between the [kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap "Kneecap") and the [femur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur "Femur"). The pain is generally in the front of the knee and comes on gradually. Pain may worsen with sitting down with a bent knee for long periods of time, excessive use, or climbing and descending stairs.

Causes:

In most people with patellofemoral pain syndrome an examination of their history will highlight a precipitating event that caused the injury. Changes in activity patterns such as excessive increases in running mileage, repetitions such as running up steps and the addition of strength exercises that affect the patellofemoral joint are commonly associated with symptom onset. Excessively worn or poorly fitted footwear may be a contributing factor.
