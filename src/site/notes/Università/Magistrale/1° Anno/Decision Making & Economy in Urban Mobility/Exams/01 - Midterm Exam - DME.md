## Problem 1

Describe briefly:
##### 1.a) In terms of microeconomics, does a long-term cost function have fix costs?

No, a long term cost function does not have fix costs. In the long term, by definition, fix costs become variable. We could look at it like the company changing its size, so, the fix costs, have to vary.

##### 1.b) Indicate the diminishing returns law.

Diminishing return law is the concept for which, despite keeping to increase the production factors (capital and labor) by a significant amount, the production increases less and less.

##### 1.c) In the case of increasing return to scale, Is the marginal cost higher than the average cost? Provide a brief explanation.

No is not. With increasing return of scale, production grows faster than the production factors. This allows for greater efficiency in producing more. In this condition, the average cost decreases with production. Also, because of what has been just said, the cost of producing one extra unit of product must be lower than the unit cost of producing the current amount of units. By definition, the cost of producing one extra unit of product is the marginal cost. The marginal cost must then be lower than the average cost.

##### 1.d) Represent the short-term average cost curve and marginal cost curve.

## Problem 2

**Let’s suppose an economy with only two types of goods, $x_{1}$ (with a market price of $p_{1}$) and $x_{2}$ (a market price of $p_{2}$). The utility function of a consumer is as follows: $u(x_{1}, x_{2})$ and can not spend more than $m$. Indicate graphically the solution of his/her election (Theory of Election).**
