In **Direct public funding**, the government raises funds immediatly and pays for a project directly.

```

In **Deferred public funding**, the financial burden of the project is delayed to a future date.

```

#### Indirect public financing

```ad-Definizione

In **Indirect public financing**, the public, more than paying, makes incetives, through *garantees*, *subsidies*, without directly raising or spending funds.
```

For example, offering tax breaks to developers who invest in renewable energy projects.

### Some models

#### Public funds to public entities

A way of [[#Indirect public financing]] an infrastructure.

A public or private agent is created for the sole purpose of managing and executing a project. The public administration funds this entity.

This can happen in 3 different ways:
- [[#Public funds to public entities from chapter VII]]
- [[#Public funds to instrumental societies]]
- [[#Contributions to public business entities or state owned companies under chapter VIII]]

##### Public funds to public entities from chapter VII

Capital transfers taken from the budget to whoever is managing the project.

##### Public funds to instrumental societies

Create a company or other public entity for the sole purpose of managing a project with NO commercial income. Public funds reimburse all expenses annually.

##### Contributions to public business entities or state owned companies under chapter VIII

Similar to [[#Public funds to instrumental societies]] but the company has commercial income. It needs to be profitable.

### Deferred or fraction payment

There is a Construction contract such that, in exchange for a single price, the contractor finances the cosntruction, then, when the work is done, it gets payed back.

### English model - shadow toll

It's a concession system in which the private sector is funded receiving from the public administration a toll or fee proportional to the use of the infrastructure. This happens until the project is completely paid back.

# [[Project Finance]]

```ad-Definizione
title: Project Finance

**Project finance** involves funding a specific project (like infrastructure, power plants, or real estate) where the project's cash flows and assets are used to repay the debt and earn returns on equity.

```

Everything is based on the project performance. If the projects doesn't generate enough revenue, investors won't be repaid.

The risk is generally higher since it all depends on the project but it is distributed among the several investors.

Since the structure of project finance is more complex, it is difficult to restructure. Also, there are high supervision costs.
