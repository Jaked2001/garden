## Production function

![01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME 2024-11-04 19.24.54.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Excalidraw-2/01%20-%20Production%20and%20cost%20functions%20in%20transport%20-%20DME%202024-11-04%2019.24.54.excalidraw.png)


```ad-Definizione
title: Production function ($x$)

The **production function** is the relation between the output (*products*, $x$) and the *Capital* ($K$) and *Labor* ($L$) involved in making that product.

$
x = f(K,L)
$

```

It works under the assumption of **efficient process**: given $K$ and $L$, we have the best output possible.

### Indicators
#### Average Productivity

```ad-Definizione
title: Average productivity

$
P_{av,L} = \frac{x}{L} \qquad P_{av, K} = \frac{x}{K}
$

```

#### Marginal Productivity

```ad-Definizione
title: Marginal Productivity ($P_{ma,L}$,$P_{ma,K}$ )

Marginal productivity is a measure of how many units of input are necessary to increase the output of 1 unit.

$
P_{ma,L} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial L} \qquad P_{ma, K} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial K}
$

```


### Characteristics

Usually, a [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Production function\|#Production function]] tends to have the following characteristics:
- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Monotony of a production function\|Monotony]]
- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Convexity of a production function\|Convexity]]

#### Monotony of a production function

```ad-Teo
title: Monotony of the Production function

The [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Production function\|#Production function]] increases when the labor or the capital increases, or, at the very least, it does not increase. It NEVER decreases.
$
\frac{\partial x}{\partial L} \ge 0 \qquad \frac{\partial x}{\partial K} \ge 0 
$
```



#### Convexity of a production function

```ad-Teo
title: Convexity of the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Production function\|#Production function]]

The product $X$ grows *slower and slower* as the Labor or the Capital keep increasing.

$
\frac{\partial^{2} x}{\partial^{2} L} = \frac{\partial P_{ma,L}}{\partial L} \le 0 \qquad \frac{\partial^{2} x}{\partial^{2} K} = \frac{\partial P_{ma,K}}{\partial K} \le 0
$

```


### Iso-production curves

They show what are the admissible combinations of labor and capital for a given value of the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Production function\|#Production function]].

![Iso-production curves - 01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME 2024-11-04 19.45.12.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Excalidraw-2/Iso-production%20curves%20-%2001%20-%20Production%20and%20cost%20functions%20in%20transport%20-%20DME%202024-11-04%2019.45.12.excalidraw.png)


### Diminishing return law

Assuming a production function x=f(K,L), if ΔL (or Δk) and K is constant (or L), then productivity increases proportionally more than the productive factor until at a level upon which the productivity diminishes.

![Schermata 2024-11-04 alle 20.55.51.png](/img/user/Schermata%202024-11-04%20alle%2020.55.51.png)

### Return to scale

Return to scale is the concept of relating how fast the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Production function\|#Production function]] increases with the increase of the inputs:

#### Increasing return to scale

We have an **increasing return to scale** when the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Production function\|#Production function]] increases *more than proportionally* with the inputs.

#### Constant return to scale

We have a **constant return to scale** when the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Production function\|#Production function]] increases *proportionally* with the inputs.

#### Reducing return to scale

We have a **reducing return to scale** when the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Production function\|#Production function]] increases *less than proportionally* with the inputs.

### Types of function

There are a few [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Iso-production curves\|#Iso-production curves]] that are often used in the field:
- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Cobb-Douglas\|#Cobb-Douglas]]
- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Leontief\|#Leontief]]

#### Cobb-Douglas

![Cobb-Douglas - 01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME 2024-11-04 21.04.33.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Excalidraw-2/Cobb-Douglas%20-%2001%20-%20Production%20and%20cost%20functions%20in%20transport%20-%20DME%202024-11-04%2021.04.33.excalidraw.png)


The **Cobb-Douglas** [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Iso-production curves\|#Iso-production curves]] has the following equation for the [[#Production function]]
$$
f(K,L) = x = K^{a}L^{b}
$$
where:
- $a,b:$ are 2 parameters

The Cobb-Douglas function can be written linearly:
$$
\begin{align}
x &= K^{a}L^{b} =  \\
\underbrace{\ln(x)}_{\hat{x}} &= a\underbrace{\ln(K)}_{\hat{K}} + b\underbrace{\ln(L)}_{\hat{L}} = \\
\hat{x} &= a \hat{K} + b \hat{L}
\end{align}
$$
In the Cobb-Douglas function, the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Return to scale\|#Return to scale]] is:
$$
RTS = - \frac{a}{b} \frac{L}{K}
$$

#### Leontief

![Leontief - 01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME 2024-11-04 21.04.56.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Excalidraw-2/Leontief%20-%2001%20-%20Production%20and%20cost%20functions%20in%20transport%20-%20DME%202024-11-04%2021.04.56.excalidraw.png)


The **Leontief** [[#Production function]] is often used for its semplicity:
$$
f(K,L) = x = \min{(aL,bK)}
$$

### Technical Substitution Relation (TSR)

![Schermata 2024-11-04 alle 21.09.53.png](/img/user/Schermata%202024-11-04%20alle%2021.09.53.png)


## Cost Function
[[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME\|01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME]]

```ad-Definizione
title: Cost function ($CT$)

The **Cost Function**, or Total cost ($CT$) is the relation
$
CT(x,w,r) = wL+rK
$
where:
- $L,K:$ number of productive factors
- $r,w:$ unitary cost of the productive factors

```

We work under the assumption that we have the **minimum** cost for producing $x$.

### Indicators

#### Average cost

```ad-Definizione
title: Average Cost ($C_{av}$)
$
C_{av} = \frac{CT}{x}
$

```


#### Marginal cost

```ad-Definizione
title: Marginal Cost ($C_{ma}$)
$
C_{ma} = \frac{\partial CT}{\partial x}
$

```

### Properties of the cost function

#### ???

```ad-Teo
title: Teorema

There is **no** diminishing with unitary cost of the productive factors

```

- [?] What does this mean?

#### Homogeneity of the cost function

```ad-Teo
title: Homogeneity

The [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Cost Function\|#Cost Function]] is homogeneous of first grade in $r$ and $w$.

```

#### Convexity of the cost function

```ad-Teo
title: Convexity

The [[#Cost Function]] is **convex** in $w$.
```


#### Continuity of the cost function

```ad-Teo
title: Continuity

The [[#Cost Function]] is **continous** in $w$ for $w\ge 0$.

```

### Fixed and variable costs

The total cost can be divided into the following sum:
$$
CT = CF + CV
$$
where
- $CF:$ [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Fixed cost\|#Fixed cost]]
- $CV:$ [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Variable cost\|#Variable cost]]

#### Fixed cost

```ad-Definizione
title: Fixed cost

**Fixed costs** ($CF$) are costs that do not change in a given system. They can only be defined in the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Short term cost function\|#Short term cost function]].

```

#### Variable cost

```ad-Definizione
title: 

**Variable costs** ($CV$) are costs dependent on the [[#Production function|production]] of a system.

They exist both in the [[#Short term and long term]] and the [[#Long term cost function]].
```
 
### Short term and long term

#### Short term cost function

In the short term, the [[#Cost Function]] is given by the sum of the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Variable cost\|#Variable cost]] and the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Fixed cost\|#Fixed cost]]:

![Short term cost function - 01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME 2024-11-05 12.10.50.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Excalidraw-2/Short%20term%20cost%20function%20-%2001%20-%20Production%20and%20cost%20functions%20in%20transport%20-%20DME%202024-11-05%2012.10.50.excalidraw.png)


The graph specifically shows the sum of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Average Fixed cost</mark> and the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">average Variable cost</mark> to give, in <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">blue</mark>, the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Average cost\|#Average cost]].

#### Long term cost function

In the long term, even the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Fixed cost\|#Fixed cost]] can change. Therefore, there are not [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Fixed cost\|#Fixed cost]] in the Long term cost function, only [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Variable cost\|#Variable cost]].

The long term cost function can be obtained overlapping all the [[#Short term cost function]] at different sizes of the system:

![Long term cost function - 01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME 2024-11-05 12.25.46.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Excalidraw-2/Long%20term%20cost%20function%20-%2001%20-%20Production%20and%20cost%20functions%20in%20transport%20-%20DME%202024-11-05%2012.25.46.excalidraw.png)


Each $x_{i}^{*}$ is the optimal production in the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Short term cost function\|short term]], at the given system size. All the $x_{i}^{*}$ give the long term cost function. For a business, the optimal size is that that minimizes the long term cost function.


### Efficiency

```ad-Definizione
title: Efficiency

**Efficiency** is the maximum output for a fixed numer of *productive factors*.

```

#### Types of efficiency

We can define efficiency based on different things:
- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Technical efficiency\|#Technical efficiency]]
- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Efficiency of market assignation\|#Efficiency of market assignation]]
- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Social efficiency\|#Social efficiency]]
- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Efficiency of scale\|#Efficiency of scale]]
- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Structural Efficiency\|#Structural Efficiency]]

##### Technical efficiency

```ad-Definizione
title: Techincal efficiency

**Technical efficiency** is reached when the [[#Cost Function|cost]] is minimized.

```


##### Efficiency of market assignation

When efficient market decisions are made.

##### Social efficiency

**Externalities** are included

##### Efficiency of scale

current capacity vs ideal capacity
- Ideal: combination of inputs and outputs inside the constant returns to scale
- Long-term competitive equilibrium, where production has constant returns to scale

##### Structural Efficiency

Structural efficiency is reached when production is located in the non-congested region of possibile inputs combinations.

#### How to measure efficiency

![Schermata 2024-11-05 alle 12.38.39.png](/img/user/Schermata%202024-11-05%20alle%2012.38.39.png)

### Economy of scale

[[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Average cost\|#Average cost]] $\searrow \iff \nearrow$ scale  

If the nature of a business is to take advantage of economy of scale, that business will try to grow. There will than be just a few big businesses in that sector.
### Economy of density

Economy of density is the concept in which a business sees its cost decreasing when the density of the business increases.

```ad-example
The total cost to transport passengers decreases by increasing utilisation of existing vehicle fleet and infrastructure capacity within a market area of given size.
```
