# [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Operation & Management of Transport Systems/Mini-Project/Mini Project - OMT\|Mini Project - OMT]]

Group project.
Due... ????

Every group has to measure something. Physically measure something. Not valid to download data from. Usually something related to transportation in the city. But not necessarily: ie people standing in line...

Try to be original in respect to what has been done before.


- Pick group on ATENEA
	- within a week from [[_Giornaliera/2024-10-07\|2024-10-07]]
- Pick a topic and submit to ATENEA (just 1 person needs to do it)
	- Due [[2024-10-29\|2024-10-29]]
	- 1 page
		- Title
		- How do we plan to get the data, with details
		- What are the expected conclusions
		- Present in less than 5 min to the class
		- Get feedback. It can be approved or suspended. Then have to think of another idea
- Start as soon as the idea is approved
- There is going to be a supervisor for each group (a phd student)

What needs to be submitted at the end - [[_Giornaliera/2024-01-13\|2024-01-13]] by 16:00 (all in a zip file)
1. Mini project report < 10 pages. Only what is significant (over length reports will be penalized)
	- pdf
	- An editable file (.doc, .latex,... what ever)
2. Database with .README file
3. Power point or else for final week presentation (10 min)
4. Updated web page

For each group there should be a member responsible for the website.
