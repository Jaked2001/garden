# Components of a transportation system

1. Moving parts --> Vehicle --> Provides: **Locomotion**, **Protection**
	- Sometimes protection and locomotion are provided together (cars), sometimes they are separate (ship + container)
2. Fixed parts --> Infrastructure (streets, railways,...) --> makes up a network (links + nodes)

Nodes create the demand (it's where you can enter a network). They also allow transfer from one network to another (rail --> subway) --> Networks are **hierarchal**: they build on top of each other.

- High accessibility (there are a lot of nodes) --> It has low performance 
	- Sidewalks have lots of access points (every door) but it's very slow
- Low accessibility --> High performance
	- High speed trains have stops very spread apart (> 200km) --> it's very fast.

3. Intangible parts --> How we use, manage, control moving parts and fixed parts.
