# [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Operation & Management of Transport Systems/Notes/00 - Course introduction - OMT\|00 - Course introduction - OMT]]

The course reveals fundamentals of transportation. The course will seem basic for those with engineering background.

Online pre-course: "El lenguage de la ingeneria" (MOOC). Is in spanish.

The course will present: 
- Graphical tools
	- Time-space diagram
	- Queuing diagram
- Flow theory: analysis of traffic streams (any kind of traffic)
	- $q,K, \overline{V}$ --> $q = K\overline{V}$
- Flow control:
	- Intersection control
	- Flow assignment in networks
	- Paradoxes:
		- Braess' paradox
			- If you increase the capacity of some part of the system the situation can become worse instead of better. 
		- Smith paradox
			- Applying optimal control of one node to all nodes, without considering the network as a whole, can result in negative outcome
- Observation and Measurement --> will be a group project

We will be focused on the fundamental knowledge.
- Logic
- Physics
- Analytical approach

We'll try to develop:
- Problem solving skills:
	- De-emphasize: handbooks or recipes
		- [[Highway Capacity Manual\|Highway Capacity Manual]]
		- [[Trip generation manual\|Trip generation manual]]
		- [[TQSM\|TQSM]] 

# Components of a transportation system


1. Moving parts --> Vehicle --> Provides: **Locomotion**, **Protection**
	- Sometimes protection and locomotion are provided together (cars), sometimes they are separate (ship + container)
2. Fixed parts --> Infrastructure (streets, railways,...) --> makes up a network (links + nodes)

Nodes create the demand (it's where you can enter a network). They also allow transfer from one network to another (rail --> subway) --> Networks are **hierarchal**: they build on top of each other.

- High accessibility (there are a lot of nodes) --> It has low performance 
	- Sidewalks have lots of access points (every door) but it's very slow
- Low accessibility --> High performance
	- High speed trains have stops very spread apart (> 200km) --> it's very fast.

3. Intangible parts --> How we use, manage, control moving parts and fixed parts.
