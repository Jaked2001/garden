Given link $(i,j)$, cost on the link is given by:
$$
c_{ij} = 95 + (x_{i}-x_{j})^{2} + (y_{i}-y_{j})^{2} \qquad \forall (i,j) \in A \cup \hat{A}
$$
where $x_{i}, y_{i}$ are the coordinates of node $i$.

**DEPOT:**
Since I have an even ID number (CA41844HP), I will use node A as a depot. This is node with coordinates:
$$
A = (1,4) = 11
$$
also known as node 11.
