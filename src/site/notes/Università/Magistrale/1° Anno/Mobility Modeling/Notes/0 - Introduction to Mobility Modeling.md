## Define Operation Research

Apply scientific method to complex problems arising in the Management of large scale systems made up by men, machines, materials, money... 

Developed during 2nd World War
- Improve understanging of how the modeled system works and behaves
- Acquisition of knowledge about the system being represented
- Substitution of the real system in the realization of experiments to answer questions of the type: *What would happen if...?*
- Using the model as an aid to decision making (quantitative) through ???

We will connect with 2 mathematical modeling:
- Optimization
- Simulation (not in this course)

Optimization:
Reshape some configuration of the system. Not necessarily in the best optimal way possible.


Simulation tries to emulate the reality up to the microscopic elements that make the system.

## Methodology in general OR studies

- Identify the problem
- Formulate and implement the model
- Test the model (identify that what I implemented actually does what it has to do)
- Validate with the system itself according to measurements I have from the system
- Evaluate alternatives and analyze results
- Implement solutions

3 levels of models, they differ based on the time span considered
- **Strategic level**: Long lasting effect. Decisions updated every few years
- **Tactical level**: Decisions updated every few weeks or months
- **Operational level**: Time of minutes or hours. What action do I take right way? Day-to-day decisions


### Realistic models

It doesn't mean it reflects the reality. There are abstractions.

STRATEGIC LEVEL
- Logistic systems
	- Location or capacity of wherhouses
- Transportation systems
	- Determine optimal network structure
	- Model flows of passengers or of cars

They require outcomes from the statistical models: which is the demand to expect, what is the behavior...

TACTICAL LEVEL
- Logistic system
	- ???
- Transportation systems
	- Service setting models

## Optimization

### Linear programming models

**Linear:** we use linear functions
**Programming:** program tasks not computer programs...

Sometimes the variables need to be integers or binary.

## From real problems to abstract problems

- Real applications consist of the combination of several OR models, covering each ofg them for a given purpose
- Each of the model works either at strategic level or tactical or operational.
