## Car following model

```ad-Definizione
title: Car following model

A **car following model** describes how a pair of vehicles interacts one with each other.

```

In each CFM we always have a **leader** and a **follower**.

See also: [[04 - Microscopic traffic flow modeling - OMT#Car following models]]

```ad-note
title: Observation

This is not usually stated explicitly (eccepts in Gipps' paper) but, when a leader is not available (very low traffic density), we simply assume the vehicles try to follow free-flow behaviour.
```

There are some aspects to take into account. If we start to allow lane changing, then we need to consider that the leader/follower pairs also change.

We will look into several CFM:

### General Motors

(In this class, we only looked at generations 1, 3 and 5)

Differently from [[ðŸš¦ Operation & Management of Transport Systems|ðŸš¦ OMT]], we use this notation:
- $\lambda:$ sensitivity
- $T:$ Reaction time

### General motors car-following models (1958-1961)

In the late 50's, American company [[General Motors]] started developing some [[#Car following models]]
They developed several generations of a model. The models were calibrated using real world data.

General Motors car-following models fall under the spectrum of [[stimulus-response model]].

#### GM car following models

```ad-Definizione
title: Stimulus-response models

**Stimulus-response models**, in car-following theory, describe the acceleration of the *follower* as a function of the speed relative to the leader. 
$
\rm Response = f(stimuli, sensitivity)
$
```


#### Response

In longitudinal movement, the follower can only react in 2 ways to what the vehicle in front does:
- Accelerate
- Decelerate

The response is therefore measured in terms of follower acceleration:
$
\ddot{x}_{n+1}(t+\Delta t)
$


#### Stimulus

#### Sensitivity

measures how attentive you are to traffic.



___

- **Response:** follower acceleration - $\ddot{x}_{n+1}(t+\Delta t)$ - measured at a time $t+\Delta t$ (a reaction time after $t$) - If the stimulus happens at $t$, the response always happens $\Delta t$ after the stimulus
- **Stimulus:** Relative speed - $\dot{x}_{n}(t)-\dot{x}_{n+1}(t)$
- **Sensitivity:** a proportionality factor (or function) - $\alpha$

The general model is always in the form:
$
\ddot{x}_{n+1}(t+\Delta t) = \alpha(...) \cdot \left[  \dot{x}_{n}(t) - \dot{x}_{n+1}(t)  \right]
$
Depending on the model generation then, $\alpha$ is expressed as different functions.




#### GM model Generations
#### 1st generation - GM model

In the 1st generation of the [[#General motors car-following models (1958-1961)]] the sensitivity $\alpha$ is considered constant:
$
\begin{align}
\ddot{x}_{n+1}(t+\Delta t) &= \alpha \cdot \left[  \dot{x}_{n}(t) - \dot{x}_{n+1}(t)  \right] \\
\left[  \mathrm{\frac{m}{s^{2}}}\right] &=  \left[\frac{1}{s}\right] \cdot \left[\frac{m}{s} \right]
\end{align}
$
The acceleration of the follower is directly proportional to the relative speed between the leader and the follower.

$\alpha$ and $\Delta t$ are considered constant parameters to calibrate.

```ad-note

When [[General Motors\|DM]] tried to calibrate the model, they realized that they weren't able to find a constant falue for $\alpha$. This was instead possible for $\Delta t$.

The sensitivity parameter showed large variability depending on the driving conditions, suggesting that maybe this parameter was not a constant.

```


#### 2nd generation - GM model

![04 - Microscopic traffic flow modeling - OMT 2024-12-16 16.30.23.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/1%C2%B0%20Semestre/Operation%20&%20Management%20of%20Transport%20Systems/Notes/Allegati/04%20-%20Microscopic%20traffic%20flow%20modeling%20-%20OMT%202024-12-16%2016.30.23.excalidraw.png)
%%[[04 - Microscopic traffic flow modeling - OMT 2024-12-16 16.30.23.excalidraw|ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw]]%%

GM observed that $\alpha$ had too much variation. So, they decided to use 2 different values of $\alpha$

#### 3rd generation - GM model

Since they didn't know at what point you would get a new value of $\alpha$, GM decided to use a linear function to describe $\alpha$:

![04 - Microscopic traffic flow modeling - OMT 2024-12-16 16.32.57.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/1%C2%B0%20Semestre/Operation%20&%20Management%20of%20Transport%20Systems/Notes/Allegati/04%20-%20Microscopic%20traffic%20flow%20modeling%20-%20OMT%202024-12-16%2016.32.57.excalidraw.png)
%%[[04 - Microscopic traffic flow modeling - OMT 2024-12-16 16.32.57.excalidraw|ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw]]%%

$
\ddot{x}_{n+1}(t+\Delta t) = \frac{\alpha_{0}}{[x_{n}(t)-x_{n+1}(t)]} [ \dot{x}_{n}(t) - \dot{x}_{n+1}(t) ]
$
where $\alpha_{0}$ is the sensitivity coefficient and is measured in $\rm\left[  \dfrac{m}{s}  \right]$.

So, $\alpha_{0}$ is a speed. It gives the linkage between [[04 - Microscopic traffic flow modeling - OMT|microscopic]] and [[Es 3 - LWR traffic flow theory - OMT|macroscopic]] traffic flow models.

##### Relation between 3rd gen micro model and Greenberg macro model

Integrating the 3rd generation model in time, we get (notice that the relative speed is the derivative of the spacing):
$
\dot{x}_{n+1}(t+\Delta t) = \alpha_{0} \ln{(x_{n}(t)-x_{n+1}(t))} + C
$
In terms of speed:
$
V = \alpha_{0} \ln\left( \frac{C}{k} \right)
$
We can try to find the constant of integration $C$ by the following initial conditions:
$
V = 0 \quad k= k_{j}
$
then:
$
0 = \alpha_{0}\ln{\left( \frac{C}{k_{j}} \right)} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad C = k_{j}
$
and we get:
$
V = \alpha_{0}\ln\left( \frac{k_{j}}{k} \right)
$
which looks exactly like the [[03 - Fundamentals of traffic flow modeling - OMT#Greenberg k-v model (1959)]] with $\alpha_{0} = v_{0}$, which is the optimal speed.

#### 4th generation - GM model

In the 4th generation, they proposed that $\alpha_{0}$ is not constant but dependent on the speed of the follower:
$
\alpha_{0} = \alpha' \dot{x}_{n+1}(t)
$
the model is then
$
\ddot{x}_{n+1}(t+\Delta t) = \frac{\alpha'\dot{x}_{n+1}(t)}{[x_{n}(t)-x_{n+1}(t)]} [ \dot{x}_{n}(t) - \dot{x}_{n+1}(t) ]
$
where
- $\alpha'$ is a-dimensional

This means that how attentive you are,  not only depends on the spacing, but also on the traveling speed (more attentive the faster you go)

! We still have 2 parameters.

#### 5th generation - GM model

2 parameters are added, $n$ and $l$. They have no known physical meaning, but they're useful to hav more flexibility in calibrating the model.

$
\ddot{x}_{n+1}(t+\Delta t) = \frac{\alpha'[\dot{x}_{n+1}(t)]^{n}}{[x_{n}(t)-x_{n+1}(t)]^{l}} [ \dot{x}_{n}(t) - \dot{x}_{n+1}(t) ]
$

All the [[#General motors car-following models (1958-1961)]] are a particular case of the 5th gen model.

### 3 car following model

This is an extension of the [[#General Motors]] models, proposed by Fox-Lemann in 1967. They account for 3 cars at the same time, where the follower is affected both by the leader and the leader's leader stimuli:

$$
\ddot{x}_{n+2}(t+T) = \alpha \dot{x}_{n+2}(t+T) \left[ \omega_{1} \frac{\dot{x}_{n+1}(t)-\dot{x}_{n+2}(t)}{x_{n+1}(t) - x_{n+2}(t)} + \omega_{2} \frac{\dot{x}_{n}(t)-\dot{x}_{n+1}(t)}{x_{n}(t) - x_{n+1}(t)} \right] 
$$

### Collision avoidance models

```ad-Definizione
title: Collision avoidance models

The main principle behind **collision avoidance models** is that a driver will place themselves at a certain distance from the leading vehicle, such that in the event of an emergency stop by the leader, the follower will come to rest without striking the leading vehicle

```

Models that fall under this category are:
- Pipes (1953)
- Gipps (1981)
- Mahut (1999-2001) - improvement over Gipps' model

#### Pipes model (1953)


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/universita/magistrale/1-anno/1-semestre/operation-and-management-of-transport-systems/notes/04-microscopic-traffic-flow-modeling-omt/#pipes-car-following-model-1953" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



### Pipes car-following model (1953)

Pipes' was one of the first [[#Car following models]] ever proposed.

It comes from the [[California Driving Code]]. The code stated: "*Drivers should leave a gap of one vehicle length for every $10\,\rm mph$ of traveling speed."*

This translates to:

```ad-Teo
title: Pipes model (1953)

![04 - Microscopic traffic flow modeling - OMT 2024-12-15 17.06.10.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/1%C2%B0%20Semestre/Operation%20&%20Management%20of%20Transport%20Systems/Notes/Allegati/04%20-%20Microscopic%20traffic%20flow%20modeling%20-%20OMT%202024-12-15%2017.06.10.excalidraw.png)



According to the Pipes model, *Drivers should leave a gap of one vehicle length for every $10\,\rm mph$ of traveling speed*:
$
s_{n+1}(t) = l_{n+1} + \frac{\dot{x}_{n+1}(t)}{10\,\rm mph}l_{n+1}
$

```

This model works quite well although:
- For low speeds, it yields spacing considerably lower than the measured one
- It only works for heavy traffic (this is true for any car following model)

This model is incredibly simple: in fact it has only 1 parameter: the follower length $l_{n+1}$.


</div></div>


#### Gipps model (1981)

The principle is to keep a safe distance from the leading vehicle to avoid crashing.

It's a **time discrete** model, meaning it needs time steps.

```ad-info
title: Properties
According to Gipps, the model should have the following properties:
- Model should mimic behaviour of real traffic
- Parameters should have physical meaning on driver and vehicle (easy calibration)
- Time step = reaction time
```

This model basically works as an optimization problem where the user wants to maximize their speed according to 2 constrains:
- **Acceleration constraint**: each vehicle has a maximum acceleration it can be subject to
- **Safety constraint**: the trajectory of each vehicle is affected by that of the vehicle in front

Gipps uses the following notation:
- $\tau:$ reaction time
- $V_{n}:$ derived speed of vehicle $n$
- $a_{n}:$ maximum acceleration with the driver of vehicle $n$ wishes to undertake
- $b_{n}:$ most severe braking for vehicle $n$
- $s_{n-1}:$ effective length of vehicle $n-1$
- $\hat{b}_{n-1}:$ estimated most severe braking for vehicle $n-1$ (empirically)

**ACCELERATION:**
The vehicle tries to reach desired speed.
$$
v_{n}(t+\tau) = v_{n}(t) + 2.5 a_{n}\tau \left( 1- \frac{v_{n}(t)}{V_{n}} \right)\left( \sqrt{0.025 + \frac{v_{n}(t)}{V_{n}}} \right)
$$
**SAFETY:**

$$
v_{n}(t+\tau) = b_{n}\tau + \sqrt{b_{n}^{2}\tau ^{2} - b_{n}[2(x_{n-1}(t))-s_{n-1}-x_{n}(t)]} \cdot \sqrt{-v_{n}(t)\tau - \frac{v_{n-1}(t)^{2}}{\hat{b}_{n-1}}}
$$
After estimating both quantities, Gipps selects the minimum value of speed between the two, and assigns that to the vehicle.

```ad-important

- Computationally **fast**
- Reproduces **real macroscopic** behaviour
- Includes reaction time

```


#### Mahut

A generalization of [[#Gipps model (1981)]].

2 models:
- constrained (linear)
- unconstrained (non linear)

Drive is subject to maximum speed from 2 constraints:
- Acceleration constraint
	- Physical limitations for speed and acceleration
	- Driver's desire for comfort
- Safety constraint
	- Affected by next downstream vehicle
	- Related to steady state properties and condition of stability

- Traffic stream is homogeneous
- Free flow speed constant for each vehicle
- State vector (position, speed, acceleration) denoted by $a(t)$

Mahut's model introduces stochastic variations over Gipps' model


## Newell

[[Newel Notes_Catalina Vargas.pdf]]

Based on trajectories.
$$
x_{n}(t+\tau_{n}) = x_{n-1}(t)-d_{n}
$$
Trajectory of follower is the same as the leader with a translation in space and time.
2 parameters:
- $\tau_{n}:$ translation in time
- $d_{n}:$ translation in space

Spacing is proportional to velocity

Doesn't consider reaction time directly but there is a variable, $T_{n}$, that can be associated to it.

There is a relation with macroscopic behaviour.

- Only on homogeneous highways
- No lane change
- Does not specify

Every driver has a desired speed. If the leader is going faster, the follower will just keep the  desired speed.

## Hidas (2005)

[[Hidass Lane changing model.pdf]]

- Car following model has sudden deceleration
	- If spacing goes below the desired spacing, it uses emergency breaking deceleration

![Schermata 2025-04-09 alle 11.14.15.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/2%C2%B0%20Semestre/Traffic%20Simulation%20Models/Notes/Allegati/Schermata%202025-04-09%20alle%2011.14.15.png)

**Time to End of Lane.** Lane is ending, lane change needs to happen.

The model is a dynamic process that keeps updating. It's described through a flow chart that goes through many different states and changes the behaviour of DVA accordingly.


## Intelligent Driver Model

[[IDM.pdf]]

The Intelligent Driver Model was developed by Triber, Hennecke and Helbing around the year 2000.

Its **high level goals** are:
- Simulate **intelligent** drivers - braking and accelerating
- Microscopic, time and space continuous
- 1 lane behavior
- 1 or multiple types of vehicles

The general equation of the model takes the following form:
$$
\text{Acceleration} = \text{max acceleration} \times (1 - \text{freeflow acceleration} - \text{interaction term})
$$
This is expressed as:
$$
\dot{v}_{\alpha} = a^{(\alpha)} \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{v_{\alpha}}{v_{0}^{(\alpha )}} \right)^{\delta} - \left( \frac{s^{*}_{\alpha}(v_{\alpha}, \Delta v_{\alpha})}{s_{\alpha}} \right)^{2}  \right]
$$
where:
- $v_{\alpha}:$ current speed
- $v_{0}^{(\alpha)}:$ desired speed
- $s_{\alpha}^{*}:$ desired spacing (see expression later) 
- $s_\alpha:$ current spacing

As the current speed approaches the desired speed, acceleration is reduced more and more.

$$
s_{\alpha}^{*} = s_{0}^{\alpha} + s_{1}^{\alpha} \sqrt{\frac{v_{\alpha}}{v_{0}^{\alpha }}}+ T^{\alpha}v + \frac{v \Delta  v}{2\sqrt{a(\alpha)b(\alpha)}}
$$
where:
- $s_{0}:$ minimum distance between cars
- $s_{1}:$ spacing dependent on speed
- $a,b:$ comfortable acceleration and deceleration
- $T:$ headway in time

Some parameters need calibration:
- $a,b$
- $T$
Some are easily defined:
- $s_{0}, s_{1}$
- $\delta:$ acceleration exponent (usually =4)
- $v_{0}:$ desired speed


![Schermata 2025-04-10 alle 12.56.41.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/2%C2%B0%20Semestre/Traffic%20Simulation%20Models/Notes/Allegati/Allegati/Schermata%202025-04-10%20alle%2012.56.41.png)

The diagram above shows possible traffic states according to this model.
- FT: Free Flow traffic
- Most of these states appear after a perturbation (one driver performs hard braking)
- Reproduces well many real world jams
- Subject to histeresis: perturbances always make traffic worse
- Heavy traffic may not cause congestion until a small perturbance appears without change in other conditions

Comments:
- Many parameters but only a few affect the model
	- Choice of $a$, $b$ and $T$ is still not trivial and may cause **instability**
- **No reaction time** (explicit). There is a safe headway as $Tv$
- Some states can only happen if drivers are "not intelligent"
- There are some jams that happen despite the bad driving behaviour. This means that even self driving could not solve all traffic issues

- Can't do simulation with infinite precision
	- If we ever get inside safety margin, we would get negative speeds


## Krauss

Krauss' model is the default model available in [[SUMO\|SUMO]].

Krauss found some problems with the existing models:
- Unknown ranges of application
- How models relate to each other
These problems are mainly caused by:
- Too many assumptions
- Large number of parameters



It's a [[#Collision avoidance models]].

It introduces a randomization parameter.

Krauss presents a family of models based on Gipps's family:
- High acceleration
- High deceleration low acceleration
- Low deceleration low acceleration
with the following considerations:
- Discrete space coordinates
- Deterministic jamming
- Multilane Traffic
- Computational performance


It has some pretty strong assumptions:
$$
l = \tau = 1
$$
both spacing and reaction time are set equal to 1 (units are not specified). This is quite strong. A lot of information is lost in this. The accuracy of the model is still pretty good because of the randomization parameter, $\eta$.

The random parameter is added as a random reduction in speed:
$$
v(t+\Delta t) = \max{( 0, v_{des}(t)-\eta )}
$$
where
$$
\eta \in \text{Uniform}(0,\varepsilon a)
$$
where 
$$
\varepsilon \in [0,1]
$$
Depending on the values chosen for $a$ and $b$, Krauss models can be classified into 3 types:

![03 - Car Following models - TSM 2025-04-10 19.16.30.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/2%C2%B0%20Semestre/Traffic%20Simulation%20Models/Notes/Allegati/03%20-%20Car%20Following%20models%20-%20TSM%202025-04-10%2019.16.30.excalidraw.png)


Type I:
- Big jams
- **Stable** output jam flow
- Phase separation, metastability, capacity drop

Type II:
- Some jamming
- **Unstable** output jam flow
- Phase separation not clear, jams don't scale

Type III:
- No structural jamming
- Homogeneous traffic
