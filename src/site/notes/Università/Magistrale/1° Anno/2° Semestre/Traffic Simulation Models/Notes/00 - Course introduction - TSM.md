## What is a Simulation


```ad-question
title: *What is simulation?*
Simulation is the prediction of some variables in a system, given some boundary constraints or conditions.

### Simulation

```ad-Definizione
title: Simulation

A **simulation** is an imitation of the *dynamics* of a real world process or *system* *over time*.

```

## What is a model

```ad-question
title: *What is a model?*
A model is a translation of a real world system/problem into another language, like mathematics or programming.
```

### Model

```ad-Definizione
title: Model

A **model** is a *formal* translation of a system.

```

It's a simplified representation of a system.

## Simulation vs model

A [[#Model]] represents the system itself, a [[#Simulation]] represents the operation of the system over time.

## Traffic simulation

```ad-Definizione
title: Traffic simulation

Traffic simulation is the mathematical modeling of transportation systems through the application of computer software to better help plan, design and operate transportation systems

```

## Traffic simulation models

```ad-Definizione
title: Traffic simulation models

**Traffic simulation models** are a formal representation of transportation systems that allow to represent the operation of the system by simulation.
