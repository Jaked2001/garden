The first step in Trip Generation modeling is gathering a **zoning system**: that is a group of TAZ that cover all the area of interest.

Trip generation is the first step in the [[00 - Intro to subject - TDBM#2 - Modeling|modeling]] stage of the [[00 - Intro to subject - TDBM#Classic 4 stage framework|classic 4 stage framework]].

In terms of an O/D matrix like the following, in this step we try to model the **marginal totals**: all $P_{i}$ and $A_{j}$, while the rest of the matrix entries ($d_{ij}$) stay unknown for now.
$$
\begin{matrix}
d_{11} & d_{12}  & \cdots & d_{1n} & \boldsymbol{P_{1}} \\
d_{21} & d_{22}  & \cdots & d_{2n} & \boldsymbol{P_{2}} \\
\vdots & \vdots  & d_{ij} & \vdots & \vdots\\
d_{n1} & d_{n2}  & \cdots & d_{nn} & \boldsymbol{P_{n}} \\
\boldsymbol{A_{1}} & \boldsymbol{A_{2}} & \cdots & \boldsymbol{A_{n}}
\end{matrix}
$$
where:
- $d_{ij}:$ number of trips from TAZ $i$ to TAZ $j$
- $P_{i}:$ tot number of trips generated by TAZ $i$
	- It's the sum of the colums
- $A_{i}:$ tot number of trips attracted by TAZ $j$
	- It's the sum of the rows
- $n:$ tot number of TAZs

## Growth factor

One of the main objective in travel demand modeling is being able to predict future scenarios starting from a current one. In this section, we assume trip generation/attraction per zone is known for the present, and we want to obtain a prediction of it in the future given a change in some variables (population, income, motorization...)

### Growth factor - Fratar

```ad-Definizione
title: Growth Factor - Fratar

One [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/2° Semestre/Travel Demand & Behavioural Modeling/Notes/03 - Trip generation modeling - TDBM#Growth factor\|#Growth factor]] was defined by Fratar in 1954 as:
$
F_{i} = \frac{P_{i}^{f}I_{i}^{f}M_{i}^{f}}{P_{i}^{c}I_{i}^{c}M_{i}^{c}}
$
where:
- $i:$ is the index that identifies the TAZ
- $F:$ is the growth factor
- $P$: population
- $I:$ income
- $M:$ Motorization
- $c,f:$ state wether the parameter is referred to the Current or Future scenario respectively

```

Once the growth factor is obtained, the future trips, $T^{f}_{i}$, for zone $i$, are estimated from the current $T_{i}^{c}$ as:
$$
T_{i}^{f}= F_{i} T_{i}^{c}
$$
### Growth factor - Cobb-Douglas

```ad-Definizione
title: Growth factor - Cobb-Douglas

A generalization of the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/2° Semestre/Travel Demand & Behavioural Modeling/Notes/03 - Trip generation modeling - TDBM#Growth factor\|#Growth factor]] from [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/2° Semestre/Travel Demand & Behavioural Modeling/Notes/03 - Trip generation modeling - TDBM#Growth factor - Fratar\|Fratar]] is given by [[Cobb-Douglas\|Cobb-Douglas]] production functions. This formula has the same form of the previous one, but can take any parameters the researcher wants to use and also adds an extra parameter, $\theta_{k}$ to be calibrated in respect with past situations:
$
F_{i} = \prod_{k=1}^{k=p} \left(  \frac{X_{k}^{f}}{X_{k}^{c}}  \right)^{\theta_{k}}
$

```


## Category analysis

In category analysis we don't use the TAZs to describe trip generation. We only use factors that describe the population.

```ad-example

For example, we know how many trips are generated by a household of a certain size with a certain number of workers:

![Schermata 2025-04-01 alle 12.43.18.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/2%C2%B0%20Semestre/Travel%20Demand%20&%20Behavioural%20Modeling/Notes/Allegati/Schermata%202025-04-01%20alle%2012.43.18.png)

For example, the table above shows that  a household with 3 people (2 of which are workers) generate 2.661 trips from Home to Work.
```

- It only uses categorical exploratory variables
- It is not related to Transport Analysis Zones (at a first stage)

Once the current situation is known, then we will have to apply it to **forecast** future trip generation (therefore, we will need to refer each generation to a zone).

```ad-example

Here we show an example of category analysis taking into consideration HH income and autos owned.

![Schermata 2025-04-01 alle 12.51.31.png|350](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/2%C2%B0%20Semestre/Travel%20Demand%20&%20Behavioural%20Modeling/Notes/Allegati/Allegati/Schermata%202025-04-01%20alle%2012.51.31.png)

20 HH where interviewed and each stated the number of trips produced.

Given the distribution observed, we create 2 factors: one for number of cars, one for income:
- Number if cars:
	- 0
	- 1
	- 2 or more
- Income:
	- $\le 6$
	- $6< \text{Income}\le9$
	- $9<\text{Income}\le12$
	- $12<\text{Income}\le15$
	- $>15$
For each combination, we list all the household numbers that fall in that combination:

![Schermata 2025-04-01 alle 12.54.24.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/2%C2%B0%20Semestre/Travel%20Demand%20&%20Behavioural%20Modeling/Notes/Allegati/Allegati/Schermata%202025-04-01%20alle%2012.54.24.png)

For example, we can see that for a HH with income between 9 and 12 thousand pesos and 1 car, we have an HH 7 and HH 18 that combined produce 15 trips (read from first table: 7 produces 7 trips and 18 produces 8 trips).

We then calculate the average number of trips produced in each category. For example, for income between 9 and 12 thousands and 1 car, we have $\frac{7+8}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5$ trips:

![Schermata 2025-04-01 alle 13.01.19.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/2%C2%B0%20Semestre/Travel%20Demand%20&%20Behavioural%20Modeling/Notes/Allegati/Allegati/Schermata%202025-04-01%20alle%2013.01.19.png)
