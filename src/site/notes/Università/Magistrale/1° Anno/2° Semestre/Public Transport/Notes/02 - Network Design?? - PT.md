### Time perception

On PT, we don't perceive time the same way:

|         | In veh | Access time  | Waiting time | Transfer Time |
| ------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| Average | 1.0    | 2.2          | 2.1          | 2.5           |
| Range   | 1.0    | $0.8\div4.4$ | 0.8-5.1      | 1.1-4.4       |

## Planning steps

- Strategic stage
	- Input
	- Function
		- Network and route design
	- Output
		- Set of routes
- Tactical stage
	- Input - 
	- Function
		- Frequency setting
		- Timetable development
- Operational stage
	- Function
		- Vehicle scheduling
		- Crew scheduling

2 main stakeholders:
- Users
- Operators

The interests of the users are different from those of the operator. Users want high frequency. This is not good for the operatore, since more veh are needed, bearing greater costs.

- User performance
	- Temporal coverage
	- Spatial coverage
	- Speed and comfort
	- Readability and reliability
	- Integration with other modes
 - Agency and authority cost
	 - Fixed cost:
		 - Fleet size and vehicle size
		 - Length of PT lanes
	- Variable cost
		- Distance travelled per day
		- Driver shifts
- Society (externality)


### Objectives

- Minimisation of users cost ($Zu$)
	- $A$ - Access time
	- $W$ - Waiting time
	- $T$ - In veh travel time
	- $T_{T}$ Transfer time
- Minimisation of agency cost ($Za$)
	- Infrastructure
	- ???
	- Unit costs: €/veh-h, €/veh-km, €/km-h, €/m2-h
- Minimisation of external cost ($Ze$)

### Headway
