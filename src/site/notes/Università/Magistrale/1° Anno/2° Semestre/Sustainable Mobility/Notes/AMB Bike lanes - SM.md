## Planning cycling territories

36 municipalities in Barcelona Metropolitan Area.
Area: 636 km^2

Cities closer to Barcelona are more similar to it. The farther we go, the more different it becomes. Farther away cars are used more and there are less people walking and cycling.

Still, people in the whole metropolitan area **walk** a lot!

There are 11.54 M trips/day in [[Metropolitan Area of Barcelona\|Metropolitan Area of Barcelona]]
80% < 10km

Only 50% of trips are in active mobility. 
- 1.5% is cycling


Bicivia: metropolitan network of bike paths.

Old Bicivia criteria:

| Tipology    | Recommended width | Recommended width | Physical protection |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| One way     | 2m                | 1.5m              | 0.5/0.7             |
| Two way     | 2.5m              | 2m                | 0.5/0.7             |
| Counterflow | 1.75              | 1.5               | 0.5/0.7             |

They are currently in the process of improving these criteria.

The initial goal was to HAVE some infrastructure rather than it being perfect.
