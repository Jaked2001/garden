In 2010 they decided to create one single administration for the metropolitan area to avoid political conflicts and differences between big cities and countryside.

There are 3 clusters of density:
- 1 - High density: 35'000 ha/km2
- 2 - Medium density: 10'000 ha/km2
- 3 - Low density

In XX century, around the '60s, the idea that cars would collapse cities arised. So a network of segregated road infrastructure was planned. Highways connecting centralities very far away from each other.

At the same time, the concept of **road hierarchy** was introduced.
