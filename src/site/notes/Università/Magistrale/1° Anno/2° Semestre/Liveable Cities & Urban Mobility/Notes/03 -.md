## Infrastructure

```ad-Definizione
title: Infrastructure

Works that serves as support for the development of human activities in the city

```


- Communication routes: streets, roads...
- Railwasy, metro, tram
- Bridges, viaducts
- water, gas, electricity
- Telecommunication network
- Sewage

All these infrastructure have in common:
- Large investment
- Large dimension
- Large impact
- Interconnection
- Multiple actors
- **Permanence** over time

Being permanent over time is sort of an issue. When we plan a new infrastructure, we always have to plan for the future.

### Integration

Some bridges only have one function (cross over a river)

Some other have several functions, like [[Ponte Vecchio\|Ponte Vecchio]] in [[Firenze\|Firenze]]: It crosses the river, it has shops on it...

[[Eugene Henard\|Eugene Henard]] proposed a new street in Paris, Rue Future, where he put all the fucntions into a unique structure:
- 1 floor: cars, sewage, trains, tramway...

Another approach is from [[L. Hilberseimer\|L. Hilberseimer]]: the [[Vertical City\|Vertical City]]. This was never made, but something similar can be found in [[Hong Kong\|Hong Kong]].
