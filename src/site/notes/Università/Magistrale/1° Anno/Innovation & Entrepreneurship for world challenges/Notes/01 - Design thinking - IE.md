# Design thinking vs Lean vs Agile

They tackle different phases of the innovation process
- Generation of the product/service area
- ???


It's always an **iterative project**.

## Design Thinking

```ad-Definizione
title: Design Thinking (DT)

**Design Thinking** is a framework for innovation.

It's also the essential tool for simplifying and humanasing.

```

Design Thinking is a problem solving framework (it's a toolbox) that is:
- Human-centric
- Iterative
	- Foster co-creation
- Solution-based
	- It's a structured process

## Design Thinking Framwork

Get in the client shoes.

Steps for [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Innovation & Entrepreneurship for world challenges/Notes/01 - Design thinking - IE#Design Thinking\|#Design Thinking]]:
- Empathize
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
	- Something that is fake. For example, for Apps, make a mock-up
- Test
- Implement

You may jump from "implement" to "empathize" if something is wrong with the final product.

What's different in DT from classical designing:
- Degree of uncertainty, in how open-ended the problem is
- Classic engineering design usually starts at requirements and specifications developed by others
- DT provides an alternative way of dealing with ideation and interaction with stakeholders
- This is not strictly new

### Some tools for DT

![01 - Design thinking - IE 2024-10-25 11.49.04.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Excalidraw-2/01%20-%20Design%20thinking%20-%20IE%202024-10-25%2011.49.04.excalidraw.png)


#### Persona-Scenario

One of the first thing to do is to focus on what are the **personas** and what is the **scenario**.
##### Persona
- Creation of *virtual profiles of individuals* which represent the type of user, customers or agents that are related to a given opportunity for innovation
- If the profiles are defined in depth, the members of the team can *think and act persons would*, thus directly generating relevant information about preferences, needs, problems, ...
- ???

##### Scenario

- Scenario describes both stories and context for each persona developed to reflect the real, major user groups
- ???
- ???
- Good scenarios are **concise** but answer the following key questions:
	- Who is the user?
		- User personas that have been developed to ???
	- Why does the user needs/expects
	- What goals does he/she have

- Make a central matrix of the topic (3x3)
- Around the centre cell, put ideas related to it: things that need to be addressed
- Expand each perimeter cell into an other matrix

### Creative Matrix

- Tool to generate ideas in a structured way, that fosters cross-pollination as we are looking to fill with ideas each cell where topics intersect
- It’s often used with columns as categories related to people (e.g., personas, market segments...) and the rows as categories for enabling solutions (e.g., technologies, environments...)
- Is not intended to be limited to one single idea per cell, and participants can take advantage of these “mashups” of categories to generate a wide range of concepts for each one 

### Affinity Clustering

![Schermata 2024-11-08 alle 11.21.10.png](/img/user/Schermata%202024-11-08%20alle%2011.21.10.png)

- Method used to organize many ideas into groups with things in common
- Useful to analyse large amounts of data and to discover hidden relationships
- We can make use of headers, subheaders, clusters, arrows, etc… anything graphical aid that helps to see the bigger picture
