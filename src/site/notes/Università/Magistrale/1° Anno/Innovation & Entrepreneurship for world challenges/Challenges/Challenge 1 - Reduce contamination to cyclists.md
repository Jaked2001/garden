# [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/Innovation & Entrepreneurship for world challenges/Challenges/Challenge 1 - Reduce contamination to cyclists\|Challenge 1 - Reduce contamination to cyclists]]

[[2024-10-04\|2024-10-04]]

Cyclist are, however, the most exposed to NOx and solid particles contamination.

How might we reduce the contamination effects on cyclists in current cities so their number could increase and effectively replace car and motorbike density.

## Solution idea

### ðŸ§  Brainstorm







## Development plan


Next week:
- Development plan (steps) to implement / to build a startup to sell or exploit the idea (40 min)
- Presentation (5 min/team) and discussion (up to 1h)

## Comments

- Every presentation needs to be self contained. We all have to cover the problem
- An app is not a product. What you sell is a **service** and the app is a **user interface**
- "Iterative prototyping" sounds better than "trial and error"

## Real solutions

### [[AIRISE\|AIRISE]]

Academic project by multidisciplinary team.

The challenge given them
- [[Sustainable Development Goals\|Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDG)11 - Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

They identified that cyclists where the most affected by air pollution.


They realized that most sensors publicly available provided just average. It didn't take into account that at any point in the day, the concentration might be higher than the average.

The made a model: [[Caliope urban model\|Caliope urban model]]

Starting from only 12 sensor in the city, they made a model taking into account winds, and other things getting to a scale of 10 metres.

The model development of such scale, it takes 3 months.

### AEP course & [[Reby\|Reby]]

They weren't allowed to work in Barcelona, just around it. They put on mobility scooters a set of sensors. They generated maps of the contamination in the city using data collected by these scooters.

Gas sensors have slow response. They needed to adjust the data. The data registered at one point, actually refers to a point behind.


### [[Lobelia Air\|Lobelia Air]]

It's a running company.

They use public data obtained by the 12 stations + satellites data provided by the EU. With a very few sensors they have a model of the city which is a lot simpler (less accurate) but also requires much less computational power. 

They provide API to companies.
