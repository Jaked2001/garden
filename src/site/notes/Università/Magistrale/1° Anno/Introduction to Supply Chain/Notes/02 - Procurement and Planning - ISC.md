## Customization and Postponement

### Postponement

```ad-Definizione
title: Postponement

Postponement is the delay or defer of the final part of production process untile the latest time possible. 

```

#### Postponement benefits

- Service improved dramatically
- Less complexity
- Flexibility to fit demand
- Inventory levels declined
- Lower storage costs

#### Postponement needs

- Modular design of products
- Feasible to decouple primary & postponement operations
- High value products
- Flexible production capacity
- Short & reliable lead time

### Customization

```ad-Definizione
title: Customization

**Customization** is a production/preparation process where the output is tailored to the requirements of the customer.

```

```ad-example
title: Example - Dell computers

Dell allows you to fully customize your computer upon purchase: processor, memory, storage...

```

#### Customization benefits

- Higher added value
- Can charge a premium price
- Method of differentiation
- Builds brand strength & loyalty
- Produce to order, lower inventory

#### Customization needs


- Lean and Efficient SC process
- Close integration with suppliers
- Effective use of information
- Flexible production capacity
- High degree of automation


## Demand planning

```ad-Definizione
title: Demand planning

Demand planning is the science of planning customer demand to give visibiity to business and [[01 - Introduction to supply chain - ISC|SC]].

```

It is important to keep in mind that the **forecast will NEVER be correct**.

### Demand planning KPI

#### SSP1/SSP3

```ad-Definizione
title: SSP

It's the ratio between the actual units sold and the forecast minus 1. It's calculated at 1 month and 3 months:
$
SSP_{n}= \frac{\sum\limits \text{n month actual}}{\sum\limits \text{n month forecast}} - 1 \quad [\%]
$
- Perfect SSP = 0%

```

#### Forecast accuracy

- [?] I don't understand what the symbols mean. How is this calculated?



SELL-IN VS SELL-OUT

Sell in:
- From You to the client: Quantity selling to the client
- What your client is selling to the consumer

What information would you prefer to have if you had to choose: The SELL-OUT
I can predict the sell-in based on the sell-out.

In an ideal world, Sell-IN=Sell-OUT.

Often we don't work with sell-OUT, because the client doesn't disclose it (at least for free).



## Demand planning

## Bullwhip effect

```ad-Definizione
title: 

The **bullwhip effect** is a demand distortion that travels upstream in the [[01 - Introduction to supply chain - ISC#Supply chain|supply chain]] from the customer to the wholesaler, manufacturer and supplier due to the variance of orders which may be larger than that of sales.

```

![Schermata 2024-10-21 alle 18.16.10.png](/img/user/Schermata%202024-10-21%20alle%2018.16.10.png)


We always sell 1000u + we have 1000u of safety stocks

One day we sell 2000u.

This might induce to send 2000u+1000u to refill (the sold + the new stock).

This can reflect in any step of the supply chain since there are always safety stocks.

```ad-example

Diapers
It seemed they were selling more size 4 diapers than usual.

It seemed they were doing very goood. Then the supermarket stopped asking for refill.

What happened is that the white brand of the supermarket run out, so they sold more pampers. When they restocked, they stopped selling pampers.

___

EXAMPLE 2

Volvo. They had a lot of green cars. So they started lowering the price of the green cars. So they started to sell more green cars. As a result the factory started producing more green cars.



```

### Bullwhip effect Causes

Main **causes** of Bullwhip effect:
- Lack of communication/information
- No forecast visibility

Other causes:
- Sales manage
- Operational
	- MOQ (Min Order Quantity)
		- Sometimes I can't ask for exactly the amount of units I need
	- Lot size
	- Frequency (Lead times) 
		- If I can only order once per month, I have to order enough for the whole month
- Prices
	- Discounts can increase demand unexpectedly


### Bullwhip effect Solutions

- Decision process
	- Understand the problem
- Physical distribution
	- Decrease lead times
	- Proper SS strategies
- Information
	- Try to share the information across the supply chain


# Sales and Operation Planning
