# [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Introduction to Supply Chain/Notes/Introduction to supply chain\|Introduction to supply chain]]

```ad-Definizione
title: Supply chain

A **supply chain** is the activities required by the organization to deliver goods or services to the consumer.

The system of suppliers, manufactures, transportation, distributors, and vendors that exists to transform raw materials to final products and supply those products to costumers.
```


**Core activities** within our organizations required to convert raw materials or component parts through to finished products or services.
- Core activies is what is essential.

Raw materials --> Producer --> Distributor --> Retailer --> Consumer

The target is to cover needs and requirements of the demand with the more efficient & minimum cost possibile.

3 things are moving through the supply chain:
- Products
- Cash
- Information

Starting from a level of service agreed, SC will ???

the right product, in the right place, at the right moment, at the right cost, at the right quality

## Historical evolution of the SC


The concept of SC is more or less recent. 

We started talking about SC around the '60s. 

in the 90s we started to talk specifically about SC as its own discipline


## Key elements

Departments of SC:
- Procurement & materials planning
- Production
- Warehousing, transport & logistics
- Demand & supply planning
- Customer Service

### Procurement

making sure we get the material.

- They ensure the sourcing of materials.
- Negotiate for good pricing

1. Identify needs & create process for direct (the product itself) and indirect (what is needed around the product - all the needs that you can't attribute directly to the product) spend.
2. Reduce risk and ensure the security of supply
	- Ensuring you always have enough material
3. Lead E2E purchase process
4. Contracts negotiation & approval
5. Lead innovation & quality & saving projects
6. Build suppliers collaboration (from "vendors to partners")


### Production & logistics

Manage & optimize

They produce the service or the product.
They are also responsible for quality control
They manage workers: safety, conditions,...
Research and development
Master plan schedule (what to produce and when to meet the needs of the costumers)

1. Master plan schedule to fit demand
2. Produce dependent & independent demand

```ad-note
title: Indipendent vs dependent demand

- Indipendent demand: the demand of the product itself that we want to sell
- Dependent demand: Things needed to produce the final product

```

3. Technical packaging
4. Innovation & continuous improvements processes & tools
5. Quality control
6. Ensure right HS&E (safety and clean regulations)
7. Cost control

### Warehousing

1. Storage, warehousing & materials handling
2. Define wh & logistric network
3. Define optimal routes and transportation methodes
4. Execute internal product movements in-between internal wh
5. Order & picking preparation. Deliver OTIF (On Time and In Full - How many times we deliver the complete quantity requested in time) to costumers
6. Inventory management

### Demand & supply planning

1. Forecasting/predicting how many units will be sold, for next 18 months
2. Lead S&OP process. Link between business & global planning
3. Ensure supply: right product in right place at right moment. Lead RCA (Route Cost Analysis - when you don't have the right number of a product, you try to understand why you're not at target and what to do get there)
4. Launches & Promos. Customization readiness
5. PIPO (Phase In - Phase Out) management
6. NPI management

### Costumer service

1. Order entry & management
2. Customer face - SPOC (Single Point of Contact) with costrumers
3. Stock control tower & delivery creation

```ad-note
title: Stock Control Tower

Stock control tower:

Let's say we have 3 oprders of a product:
- 1 --> 100
- 2 --> 200
- 3 --> 500

We need 800 units in total.

We convert order in delivering --> confirmation

If we only have a total stock of 500, we can't deliver to everyone. How we choose whom to send and whom not, is managed by Costumer Service.
```


4. Build customer collaboration
5. Billing process
6. Claims & returns Management
7. Master data - people in charge of ensuring that the data managed in the company is correct (price, billing name, unites, etc...)


## Push & Pull SC

```ad-example

Toilet paper: is a push product
Expensive cars: is a pull product

```

**Push**: can't wait for an order. Have to produce a lot of it
- Low production costs
- low volatility
- demand driven
- proactive
- standard production
- short lead time

**Pull**: Have to wait for an order prior to produce a product
- High production costs
- High volatility
- Customer Order
- Reactive
- Customized (receive order with specific characteristics to produce)
- Long lead times


```ad-note
title: Postponements

A production system.

You have 70% of the product that is the same --> create a general process and wait to the last part possibile to do the Postponements (customization) and convert from push to pull.

```

```ad-example
title: Examples of push and pull

- PUSH:
	- Cheap clothes
	- Sugar
	- Laptops
	- Construction materials (usual ones, unless there are some very specific specifications)
	- Restaurants
- PULL:
	- Public transportation vehicles

Glasses are push for most of it but then it's postponened for the crystal.

```


## Cost vs Value

SC focused on Cost
- Efficiency
- Standardized products
- Keep stock low


|                | Cost                                   | Value                                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Objective      | Supply product                         |                                                                         |
| Product design |                                        |                                                                         |
| Prices         |                                        |                                                                         |
| Production     | Decrease spend due to high utilization | Keep flexibility with capacity to response to demand variations/changes |
| Stocks         | Minimum stock to have low cost         | Have stock...                                                           |
| Suppliers      | Selection of suppliers based on cost   |                                                                         |

- $Q_1$: High cost - Low value. No one wants this

With the increase in service, a higher and higher cost is needed.

The more you grow, the cost grows a lot more than proportionally. There is not a way to have 100% service (always deliver). Usually you stay around 95-96%.

```ad-example

- IKEA: cost oriented. All simple, cheap, min decent quality
- El Corte Ingles (high end): Good costumer care, they are close to costumers, they do almost everything you ask them

```


```ad-bug
title: Discussion

- Good negotiations power on a standardized product
- They work with postmoments
- strong logistics

```
