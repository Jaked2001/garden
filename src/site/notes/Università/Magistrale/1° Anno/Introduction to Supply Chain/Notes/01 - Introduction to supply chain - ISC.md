```ad-Definizione
title: Supply chain

**Supply Chain** is all the steps necessary to bring a product from the first supplier to the consumer.

It can be defined as the system of suppliers, manufacturers, transportation, distributors, and vendors that exists to transform raw materials to final products and supply those products to customers.
```

```ad-example
title: Amazon Prime - Why is it good

What makes Amazon Prime good for the consumer:
- **Easy to use, simple, flexible, fast/quick**
- Cheap
- **Assortment**
	- Different per country
	- Wide range of products
- **Reliable**
- Priority
- Sense of security
- **Reverse logistics**
- Associated products
- Orientated
- No real competitor
- **Lots of delivery options**
- **Distribution of small businesses**

The ones in bold, are related to [[Supply Chain]].
```

Covid-19:
- Everything stopped
- Lack of essential products

The objective of Supply Chain is to have:
- The right **product**
- at the right **place**
- at the right **moment**
- at the right **cost**
- with the right **quality**

```ad-attention

Supply chain is **NOT** a synonim of logistics. 

Logistic is just a part of supply chain: it's the part when you deliver the product.

Supply chain is the entire process: from raw materials to the shelves.

```

According to Zara Founder Amancio Ortega:

```ad-quote
title: [[Amancio Ortega]] - ZARA Founder

The **Supply Chain** is our business model

```


3 things move across the SC:
- Products
- Cash
- Information

## Historical evolution of SC

- 50's: [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Introduction to Supply Chain/Notes/01 - Introduction to supply chain - ISC\|Supply Chain]] is just a synonym of physical distribution
- 60's: It's material management
- 80's: Generalization JIT, Total quality control, perfection of EDI systems
- 90's: [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Introduction to Supply Chain/Notes/01 - Introduction to supply chain - ISC\|Supply Chain]] stands as its own discipline

The procurement department is the one responsible for **making sure we get the material**.

- They ensure the sourcing of materials.
- Negotiate for good pricing

Roles:
1. Identify needs & create process for direct (the product itself) and indirect (what is needed around the product - all the needs that you can't attribute directly to the product) spend.
2. Reduce risk and ensure the security of supply
	- Ensuring you always have enough material

# [[Independent and dependent demand]]

- [[#Independent demand]]
- [[#Dependent demand]]
## Independent demand

```ad-Definizione
title: Independent demand

**Independent demand** is the demand of the product itself. The product that we want to sell.

```

## Dependent demand

```ad-Definizione
title: Dependent demand

Dependent demand is the demand of all the things needed to produce the final product.

```

```ad-note
title: Stock Control Tower

Stock control tower:

Let's say we have 3 oprders of a product:
- 1 --> 100
- 2 --> 200
- 3 --> 500

We need 800 units in total.

We convert order in delivering --> confirmation

If we only have a total stock of 500, we can't deliver to everyone. How we choose whom to send and whom not, is managed by Costumer Service.
```

4. Build customer collaboration
5. Billing process
6. Claims & returns Management
7. Master data - people in charge of ensuring that the data managed in the company is correct (price, billing name, unites, etc...)


## Push & Pull SC

Depending on weather the production is on demand or the company simply keeps producing the product anyway, the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Introduction to Supply Chain/Notes/01 - Introduction to supply chain - ISC\|Supply Chain]] can be categorized as a:
- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Introduction to Supply Chain/Notes/01 - Introduction to supply chain - ISC#Push SC\|#Push SC]]
- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Introduction to Supply Chain/Notes/01 - Introduction to supply chain - ISC#Pull SC\|#Pull SC]]

```ad-example

Toilet paper: is a push product
Expensive cars: is a pull product

```

### Push SC

```ad-Definizione
title: Push SC

In a **Push SC**, we never wait for orders in order to produce the product. We have to produce a lot of it.

```

A push SC has the following characteristics:
- Low production costs
- Low volatility
- Demand driven
- Proactive
- Standard production
- Short lead time



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/universita/magistrale/1-anno/introduction-to-supply-chain/notes/02-procurement-and-planning-isc/#postponement" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



### Postponement

```ad-Definizione
title: Postponement

Postponement is the delay or defer of the final part of production process untile the latest time possible. 

```

#### Postponement benefits

- Service improved dramatically
- Less complexity
- Flexibility to fit demand
- Inventory levels declined
- Lower storage costs

#### Postponement needs

- Modular design of products
- Feasible to decouple primary & postponement operations
- High value products
- Flexible production capacity
- Short & reliable lead time


</div></div>


Postponement is a production system based moostly (about 70%) on a [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Introduction to Supply Chain/Notes/01 - Introduction to supply chain - ISC#Push SC\|#Push SC]], that, just for the final part, holds the product and personalizes it according to an order.

It basically convert to a [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Introduction to Supply Chain/Notes/01 - Introduction to supply chain - ISC#Pull SC\|#Pull SC]] just for the final part.

### Pull SC

```ad-Definizione
title: Pull SC

In a **Pull SC**, we wait for an order prior to producing a product.

```

It has the following characteristics:
- High production costs
- High volatility
- Customer Order
- Reactive
- Customized (receive order with specific characteristics to produce)
- Long lead times

It basically convert to a [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Introduction to Supply Chain/Notes/01 - Introduction to supply chain - ISC#Pull SC\|#Pull SC]] just for the final part.

Examples:

```ad-example
title: Examples of push and pull

- PUSH:
	- Cheap clothes
	- Sugar
	- Laptops
	- Construction materials (usual ones, unless there are some very specific specifications)
	- Restaurants
- PULL:
	- Public transportation vehicles

Glasses are push for most of it but then it's postponened for the crystal.

```


## Cost vs Value

SC focused on Cost
- Efficiency
- Standardized products
- Keep stock low


|                | Cost                                                     | Value                                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Objective      | Supply product/service at low cost                       | Quick response to demand                                                |
| Product design | Maximize performance at min cost                         | Modularity to allow product differentiation                             |
| Prices         | Low margins due to price is the driver of main customers | High margins as price is NOT a driver of main costumers                 |
| Production     | Decrease spend due to high utilization                   | Keep flexibility with capacity to response to demand variations/changes |
| Stocks         | Minimum stock to have low cost                           | Have stock to response demand variation / supply uncertainty            |
| Suppliers      | Selection of suppliers based on cost (& quality)         | Selection of suppliers based on flexibility, responsiveness & quality   |

Optimizing the supply chain

![Schermata 2024-10-26 alle 20.49.50.png](/img/user/Schermata%202024-10-26%20alle%2020.49.50.png)

With the increase in service, a higher and higher cost is needed.

The more you grow, the cost grows a lot more than proportionally. There is not a way to have 100% service (always deliver). Usually you stay around 95-96%.

```ad-example

- IKEA: cost oriented. All simple, cheap, min decent quality
- El Corte Ingles (high end): Good costumer care, they are close to costumers, they do almost everything you ask them

```

```ad-bug
title: Discussion - characteristics of McDonald

- Good negotiations power on a standardized product
- They work with [[02 - Procurement and Planning - ISC#Postponement]]
- strong logistics

```
