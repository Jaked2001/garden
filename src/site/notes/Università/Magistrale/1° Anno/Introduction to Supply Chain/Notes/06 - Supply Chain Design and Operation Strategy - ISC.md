## Competitive winning factors

What are the 4 operations winning factors?
- **Cost**
	- Very efficient
	- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/01 - Production and cost functions in transport - DME#Economy of scale\|Economy of scale]]
- **Quality**
	- High quality standards
- **Service**
	- Related to **availability** (go to supermarket and you find it)
	- Reliable
	- Customer priority above other variables
- **Flexibility**
	- Prepared to all costumer requests
	- Related to service but: special preparations, like giving delivery window...

The winning factor is a decision we make. It's not given by the market. 
We **cannot** have all the 4 winning factors. Only 1, maybe 2

**COST + SERVICE**
- Commodities - drinks, papare, sugar....

**QUALITY + FLEXIBILITY**
- Luxury
- Loyal costumers
	- Nike, POLO, Rolex

**COST + QUALITY**
- Smart purchasing
	- VW, Toyota

**SERVICE + FLEXIBILITY**
- Ecommerce - Amazon

**QUALITY + SERVICE**
- New entries - Starbucks

**COST + FLEXIBILITY**
- Leader brands - Zara, Dell

## 3 levels of operation decision

- Strategic
	- About the what
		- Objectives
		- Supply policies
		- Network design
- Tactical
	- About how
		- Demand forcasting
		- Production, procurement
		- Inventory targets
- Operational
	- About the "do"
		- Daily life activities
		- Execution KPIs

## Tips creating strategy

- The sum is more important than the parts
	- Integrate all the parts of the system
- The strategy MUST be aligned with Business strategy
- The design, the process optimization and management are key competitive advantages
- Successful recipes pass - results review and formulation
	- It's important to know our history but don't get stuck on "it's always been like this"
- A good strategy prepares you to face potential problems


Strategy is key but don't forget execution. 


Competitive advantages are not always durable over time.
