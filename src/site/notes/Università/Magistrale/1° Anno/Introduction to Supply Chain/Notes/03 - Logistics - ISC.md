### Direct distribution

- Direct from factory to consumer
- Avoid intermediate products
- Requires high flexibility to have a quick & reliable response to customers

### Staggered distribution

- Based in one or some central warehouses thar receive product from factories / suppliers and deliver to second raw of regional warehouses
- Requires high investment on infrastructure & duplicated stock
- Give a **very quick response** to customers

### Central warehouses

- Eliminates the need of regional warehouses and uses Cross-docking platforms to deliver
- The product can be delivered to this Cross-Dock platforms from different locations and there it occurs the group preparation
- Less infrastructure even big spaces are needed

Cross-dock platform is a place where the product is not stopped or stored. Funge tipo smistamento treni.


# Reverse Logistics

- What is reverse logistic
- Direct vs Reverse logistic
- Reverse logistic process

## Reverse logistics

```ad-Definizione
title: Reverse logistic

**Reverse logistic** is the [[#03 - Logistics - ISC|logistic]] necesseray to take back the product from the point of consumption to the distributor.

```

- Processing returned products for reasons such as damage, seasonal, restock, recall or excess inventory
- Recycling packaging materials and reuse
- Reconditioning and remanufacturing products
- Obsoletes
- Hazardous material programs
- Asset recovery

Sometimes, is cheaper to leave the product to the consumer.

### Direct vs reverse logistic

![Schermata 2024-11-18 alle 18.14.07.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/Introduction%20to%20Supply%20Chain/Notes/Allegati/Schermata%202024-11-18%20alle%2018.14.07.png)

![Schermata 2024-11-18 alle 18.21.08.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/Introduction%20to%20Supply%20Chain/Notes/Allegati/Schermata%202024-11-18%20alle%2018.21.08.png)

- In Reverse logistic we don't know how many products we will have to return
- Transport is from many to one
- Non uniform quality
- Non uniform price
	- Costumer buys at discount and returns at full price
	- There is a discount if you buy a lot of units. If you don't return all of them, it becomes more complicated
- Revers cost is not always visible - there are hidden costs
	- Costumer is not home when the courier comes to pick up the return
- Complex inventory management
- Complex product lifecycle
	- Ex. food - if it has expiration date, it will be closer to expiration at return
- Speed is not critical

#### Costs

- Transport
	- Higher cost due to more kilometres
- Thied
	- Less probability of item being stolen
- Obsolete
	- Products are more obsolete
- Pickup
- Condition
- Quality

### Process

![Schermata 2024-11-18 alle 18.26.08.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/1%C2%B0%20Anno/Introduction%20to%20Supply%20Chain/Notes/Allegati/Schermata%202024-11-18%20alle%2018.26.08.png)

!! We refund as soon as we get the product. We check quality after.

After return, the product can go back to inventory, or to secondary market

### Key factors for logistic success


**MERCADONA automatic warehouse**:
- Everything is automated -> prevent a lot of physical work
	- Workers have more of a supervision and maintenance work
- They manage 6000 kind of products - diveded in 2 categories
	- High rotation products (milk, water) --> they send the full pallet to the shops, without picking
	- Low rotation products (spices bottles - you cannot ship 3000 of them at the same time)
- They take into account several factors to assemble the pallets
	- Volume
	- Fragility
	- Weight
- 1200 pallets/day
- 1 pallet in 2/5 min
- 24h per 6 days
- In 3 days, they pick up lettuce in field and get it ready in the supermarket


## Costumer service

```ad-quote
Costumer service is not a department. It's an attitude
```

Services provided to customers before, during and after purchase

It is the area of any organization that is responsible for answering questions, complaints, doubts and comments...
