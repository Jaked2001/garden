## Introduction

The minimum cost flow problem is described as:
1. The network is a [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Directed graph\|directed]] and [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Connected nodes\|connected]] network
2. At **least one** is a [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Supply node\|supply node]]
3. At **least one** node is a [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Demand node\|demand node]]
4. All the remaining nodes are [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Transshipment nodes\|transshipment nodes]]
5. Flow through an arc is allowed only in the direction indicated by the arrowhead. The maximum amount of flow is given by the *capacity* of that arc
6. The network has enough arcs with sufficient capacity to enable all the flow generated at the supply nodes to reach all the demand nodes
7. The cost of the flow through each arc is proportional to the amount of that flow, where the cost per unit flow is known
8. The objective is to minimize the total cost of sending the available supply through the network to satisfy the given demand. (An alternative objective is to maximize the to- tal profit from doing this)

## Problem Definition

We consider a [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Directed graph\|directed]] and [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Connected nodes\|connected]] network where the $n$ nodes include at least one [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Supply node\|supply node]] and at least one [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Demand node\|demand node]]. The decision variables are:
$$
x_{ij} = \text{Flow through arc } i\to j
$$
Known information:
- $c_{ij}:$ **cost** per unit flow through the arc $i\to j$
- $u_{ij}:$ arc **capacity** for arc $i\to j$
- $b_{i}:$ net flow generated at node $i$

The value of $b_{i}$ depends on the nature of node $i$:
- $b_{i} > 0$ if node $i$ is a [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Supply node\|supply node]]
- $b_{i}<0$ if node $i$ is a [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Demand node\|demand node]]
- $b_{i}=0$ if node $i$ is a [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Transshipment nodes\|transshipment nodes]]

**Objective**: Minimize the total cost os sending the available supply through the network to satisfy the given demand.

The linear programming formulation of this problem is given as:

```ad-Teo
title: Minimum cost flow problem
$
\text{Minimize} \quad Z = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}c_{ij}x_{ij}
$
```

**subject to**
$$
\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} x_{ij} - \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}x_{ji} = b_{i}, \quad \forall \text{ nodes } i
$$
where:
- $\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} x_{ij}:$ total flow **out** of node $i$
- $\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}x_{ji}:$ total flow **into** node $i$
and **subjet to**
$$
0\le x_{ij} \le u_{ij} \quad \forall  \text{ arcs } i\to j
$$

```ad-note

Sometimes, it is necessary to have a lower bound constrain in the flow: 
$
L_{ij} > 0
$
If this is the case, the problem can be easily reformulated translating the variables of the quantity $L_{ij}$:
$
x'_{ij} = x_{ij} - L_{ij}
$
in order to convert the problem back to the form where there is a non negativity constrain
```

### Feasibility necessary condition

```ad-Teo
title: Feasibility necessary condition

A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a minimum cost flow problem to have any feasible solutions is that:
$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}b_{i} = 0
$

This means that the total flow generated at the supply nodes equal the total flow being absorbed at the demand nodes.

```

If the condition is not met, a possible solution is to add a dummy demand node to absorb the excess supply. This node should be connected to the supply nodes with arcs of cost $c_{ij} = 0$.

### Integer solution property

```ad-Teo
title: Integer solution property

For minimum cost flow problems where every $b_{i}$ and $u_{ij}$ have integer values, all the basic variables in every basic feasible (BF) solution (including an optimal one) also have integer values.

```


### Example

```ad-example

The network below is given as an example

![01.2 - The minimum cost flow problem - From book - MM 2024-10-30 19.01.00.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Excalidraw-2/01.2%20-%20The%20minimum%20cost%20flow%20problem%20-%20From%20book%20-%20MM%202024-10-30%2019.01.00.excalidraw.png)
%%[[01.2 - The minimum cost flow problem - From book - MM 2024-10-30 19.01.00.excalidraw.md|ðŸ–‹ Edit in Excalidraw]]%%

- The number in parenthesis on the arrows are the cost in 100â‚¬/unit.

A and B are the supply nodes, while D and E are the demand nodes.

For practical purposes, all $u_{ij} = \infty$ except for arcs:
- $A\to B$ where $u_{AB} = 10$
- $C\to E$ where $u_{CE} = 80$
these values are lower than the total units produced (90).

If we calculate the total cost we would obtain:
$
Z = 2x_{AB} + 4X_{AC} + 9x_{AD} + 3x_{BC} + x_{CE} + 3x_{DE} + 2x_{ED}
$
**subject to** the following constraints:
$
\begin{cases}
&x_{AB} &+& x_{AC} &+& x_{AD} &+& 0 &+& 0 &+& 0 &+& 0 &=& 50 \\
-&x_{AB} &+& 0 &+& 0 &+& x_{BC} &+& 0 &+& 0 &+& 0 &=& 40 \\
&0 &-& x_{AC} &+& 0 &-& x_{BC} &+& x_{CE} &+& 0 &+& 0 &=& 0 \\
&0 &+& 0 &-& x_{AD} &+& 0 &+& 0 &+& x_{DE} &-& x_{ED} &=& -30 \\
&0 &+& 0 &+& 0 &+& 0 &-& x_{CE} &-& x_{DE} &+& x_{ED} &=& -60 \\
\end{cases}
$
and **subject to**:
$
x_{AB}\le 10 \qquad x_{CE} \le 80 \qquad x_{ij} \ge 0 \quad \forall i,j
$

**Any of the node constraints is redundant**, assuming a feasible solution exists.
```


## The Network SIMPLEX method

Pag. 389

The Network SIMPLEX method is a streamlined version of [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/The SIMPLEX Method\|The SIMPLEX Method]] for solving [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/01.2 - The minimum cost flow problem - From book - MM\|minimum cost flow problmes]]. It goes through the same steps:
- Finding the entering basic variable
- Determining the leaving basic variable
- Solving for the new BF solution
in order to move from the current BFS to a better adjacent one.

### Correspondence between BFS and Feasible Spanning Trees

Given a [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Tree\|tree]] with $n$ nodes, there exists a set of $n-1$ basic variables that make up the basic feasible solution.
$$
|I_{B}| = n-1
$$
The $n-1$ arcs are referred to as **basic arcs**.

The rest of the arcs, with flow $x_{ij}=0$, are referred to as **non-basic arcs**.

It can be shown that a set of basic arcs always form a [[UniversitÃ /Magistrale/1Â° Anno/1Â° Semestre/Mobility Modeling/Notes/00 - Graph - MM#Spanning tree\|spanning tree]]. Therefore, a spanning tree can be obtained as follows:
- For the arcs NOT in the spanning tree (non-basic arcs), set the corresponding variables $x_{ij} = 0$
- For the arcs in the spanning tree (basic arcs), **solve** for the corresponding variables $x_{ij}$ in the system of linear equations provided by the node constraints

It needs to be mentioned that the solution obtained as such may not be feasible. Therefore, it is necessary to define a **feasible spanning tree** as one whose solution from the node constraints also satisfies all the other constraints.

```ad-Teo
title: Fundamental theorem for the network simplex method

The basic solutions are [[00 - Graph - MM#Spanning tree|spanning tree]] solutions (and conversely), and the BFS are solutions for feasible spanning trees (and conversely).
