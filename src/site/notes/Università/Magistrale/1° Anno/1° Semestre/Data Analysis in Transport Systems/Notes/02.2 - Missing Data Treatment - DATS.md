Recall the meaning of [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Data Analysis in Transport Systems/Notes/Outlier\|Outlier]] and how to find them in our data

```ad-Definizione
title: Outlier
*According to [[Douglas Hawkins]]*

An **outlier** is an observation which deviates so much from the other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism.

```

## Types of outliers

### Mild outlier

```ad-Definizione
title: Mild Outlier

$x_{0}$ is a **Mild [[#Outlier]]** if:
$
x_{0} \not\in \left[ Q1 - 1.5\,IQR; Q3 + 1.5 \, IQR\right]
$


```


### Severe outlier


# Outlier detection

## Univariate and multivariate outlier detection

When a data sample is given, we can often assumed it to be generated by one basic generating mechanism (ex. a probability distribution like the [[Logistic distribution\|logistic]] one). Often times, the same data can be generated by 2 or more mechanisms. This could cause one set of data to have observations in 2 completely different classes of similar objects. When looking at the data through one generating mechanism, the other class would appear as a big group of [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Data Analysis in Transport Systems/Notes/Outlier\|outliers]].

### Univariate outlier detection

#### Outliers in boxplots

The [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Data Analysis in Transport Systems/Notes/02 - Exploratory Data Analysis - DATS#Boxplot\|boxplot]] is a graphical display for [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Data Analysis in Transport Systems/Notes/02 - Exploratory Data Analysis - DATS\|Exploratory Data Analysis]], where the outliers appear tagged. In the boxplot we are able to show both [[#Types of outliers]].

### Multivariate outlier detection

Outliers can be detected by computing the distance between the central point of data, by means of an iterative algorithm:
$
D^{2}_{M}(i,G) = (x_{i}-G)'V^{-1}(x_{i}-G)
$

Once we find outliers, there are several options we might consider:
- **Eliminate them** - but loose information of the eliminated observations
- **Weight** the individuals inversely to the outlying degree, to diminish their importance
- Make **robust estimation** of the parameteers of the generating mechanism without oultiers
- Declare univariate outliers as **[[#Missing values]]** and treat them as missing data
