## Function of procurement

- Purchase of products/materials
- Determine best cost/value
- Track and record orders
- Manage supply
- Analyse 


The main thing:

**BUY AT BEST PRICE**

- As procurement you want the best out of the supplier. It's a win-lose *(under traditional view)*

### Modern view of procurement

- Define procurement roadmap
- Global sourcing strategies
- Risk management
- Be a key player in the budgeting process
- Monitor and report Procurement KPI
- SRM ([[Supplier Relationship Management - SRM\|Supplier Relationship Management - SRM]])
- Adapt best practices
- External innovation
	- Innovation also comes from the different suppliers
- Manage purchasing operations

Supplier - Buyer, in the modern view, becomes a win-win

Also look at the goals of the suppliers. They become partners.


- Supply chain vs procurement vs sourcing vs purchasing
	- Supply chain
		- Procurement
			- Sourcing - management aspect
			- Purchasing - operational aspect


### Procurement process

It all starts with the **needs**

Companies only buy if there is need

9 phases:
- Sourcing
	- Needs
	- Purchase requisition: converting need in what is needed to buy
	- Asses and select vendors
- Purchasing
	- Negotiate Price and T&Cs (Terms and conditions)
	- Purchase order
	- Goods Recept + inspection
- Payment
	- 3-way matching
	- Approve invoice and peyment
	- Keep records


```ad-example

Example:
Need a car? What would you consider when buying a new car or a second hand car:
- Price
- Kilometres
- Social status
- Emissions
- Design
- Ready to go or have to wait to get it
- Technology
- ...

Really need a car?
First you need to assess if you actually need a car.

Buying a car is "Purchase". The "need" is transportation (moving from point A to B).
```



## Supplier assessment and selection

There are 2 main kind of suppliers:
- **Direct:** They deliver you the things you need for your product (Ex. Bottle <- cap, bottle, targetta)
- **Indirect:** They deliver what you need to make your company work (Ex: office supplies)

Freight company is kind of hybrid. It depends on the company.If you buy a product that costs 100€ + 5€ transportation, we can consider transportation direct (the product costs 105€), or indirect (the product is direct, 100€, transportation is indirect, 5€).

### Supplier evaluation

- Cost (the amount) & cash (how  and whenthe payments are done)
- Service
	- Capacity
	- supply
- Security of business
	- Long term relationship
	- Making sure the supplier is financially stable
- Innovation
- ESG
	- Environmental, Social and Governance

## Sourcing strategy 

We have a need and as procurement we have to define a strategy.

Each area of a company has its own need. Procurement is in the middle and needs to manage everything.

### Porter Forces

Competitive rivalry:
- **Buyer Bargain power** (ex. Phone carrier: customers can change easily)
- **Supplier bargain power** (ex. car components: many different suppliers. Power is very low. you can switch easily)
- **Threat of substitution**
- **Threat of new entrance** (ex. if you have a coffee shop, it's easy to open a new shop. A space agency it's difficult to replicate)

### Strategy definition

- Make or buy
	- Decide if we make the product in house or we have another company make the product



## Risk assessment

1. Identify
2. Assess
3. Control & priority
4. Mitigate


Risk examples:
- Geopolitical crisis
- Currency exchange rate volatility
- Natural disasters
- Bribery
- Capacity

Risk assessment matrix

### Risk mitigation

- Double sourcing
- safety stocks
- Long-term contracts
- Capacity expansion
- Not expose to exchange rate
- Anticipate regulatory aspects
- Assess conflict areas
- Shorter supply chains
- Ethical & social aspects
- Frequent audits
