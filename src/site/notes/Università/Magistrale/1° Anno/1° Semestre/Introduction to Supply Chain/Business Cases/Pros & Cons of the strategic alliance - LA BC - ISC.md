### For the general alliance

- Contract lenght (10 years)
	- Min 10 years contract allows for stability
	- No need for constant renegotiation
	- Promotes trust
- Cost structure - LA pays direct cost + fee
	- Simplicity

#### Cons

- How much “trust” they’re putting on trust.
- Loose structure of the alliance
- Contract doesn't have specific values, only formulas --> things can change a lot over time
- **Both have opened themselves to future legal issues**
	- What if top management changes
- Cost structure - LA pays direct cost + fee
	- Promotes inefficiencies
- Lack of specific direction

### For LA

#### Cons

- BLS could say bye bye we are good.
- Loss of control: Entering a strategic alliance inherently involves relinquishing some degree of control over decision making
