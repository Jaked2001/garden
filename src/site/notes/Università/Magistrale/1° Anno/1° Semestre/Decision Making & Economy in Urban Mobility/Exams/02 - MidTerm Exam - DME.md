## Problem 1

##### 1.a) Describe briefly concept or formulation of elasticity.

Elasticity is a parameter that measures how much a function react to a change in one variable, percentage wise.

Let's imagine we have a demand function $q(p)$, where $p$ is the price of the product. Then, elasticity is:
$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\frac{\partial q}{q}}{\frac{\partial p}{p}} = \frac{p}{q} \frac{\partial q}{\partial p}
$$
It tells by what percentage the demand changes, by a given percentage change in price.
