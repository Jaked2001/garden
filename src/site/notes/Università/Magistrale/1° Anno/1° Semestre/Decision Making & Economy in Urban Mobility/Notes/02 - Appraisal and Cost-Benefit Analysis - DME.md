# [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/02 - Appraisal and Cost-Benefit Analysis - DME\|02 - Appraisal and Cost-Benefit Analysis - DME]]

Every time we're about to build or design a new transportation project, we should ask ourselves whether or not it is useful or if it make sense to do it. The assessment of this is called [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/02 - Appraisal and Cost-Benefit Analysis - DME#Appraisal\|#Appraisal]].

# Appraisal

```ad-Definizione
title: Appraisal

**Appraisal** is the act of evaluationg if the project (investment, program, policies...) proposed to be carried out will be *beneficial*

```

We should make sure that only projects that **generate** value for society are carried out.

In the economic view, value is created if the benefits achieved are greater than the cost generated.

Appraisal can be made:
- EX-ANTE: before accepting the project
- POST-ANTE: After the project was built, to better manage it

## Appraisal approches

- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/02 - Appraisal and Cost-Benefit Analysis - DME#Social-economic approach\|#Social-economic approach]] (cost benefit analysis)
	- Welfare
	- Quality of life
- Financial approach
	- Evaluating if the project is profitable
- Macroeconomic approach
	- Employment
	- GDP
	- Economic activities
- Other approaches

### Social-economic approach

The aim is to satisfy the social needs considering the actual context.

The evaluation can be done following 2 approaches:
- **Evaluation by objectives**
	- Cost effectiveness analysis
- **Evaluation by effects**
	- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/02 - Appraisal and Cost-Benefit Analysis - DME#Cost-benefit analysis\|#Cost-benefit analysis]] (social profitability)
	- Multi-criteria analysis - best to choose among several options

## Cost-benefit analysis

The cost-benefit analysis aims to evaluate the impact on the whole society of an investment in mobility.

We are only interested in what we generate. Transfers between agents from a society itself are neutral. For example, tolls are not a collective cost: The individual users pay them, but the gain is for the public, meaning the balance is 0.

The aim of CBA is to maximize efficiency, ignoring effects on equality: it doesn't matter if only a portion of the population is affected, positively or negatively. We only look at the population as a whole.

### CBA stages

- There should always be at least one alternative. It can be: "do nothing"
- Identify costs and benefits
- Quantify costs and benefits
- Add all costs and benefits
- Interprete the results obtained and decision criteria
- Carry out a sensitivity analysis
- Compare the project to significant alternatives (including alternative "do nothing)

#### Costs in CBA

Costs, in [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/02 - Appraisal and Cost-Benefit Analysis - DME#Cost-benefit analysis\|#Cost-benefit analysis]], are all the resources used by society to launch and manage the new project.
- Initial investment
- Maintenance
- Operation costs

#### Benefits in CBA

The **benefits** in [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/02 - Appraisal and Cost-Benefit Analysis - DME#Cost-benefit analysis\|#Cost-benefit analysis]], are all the consequences of launching the action. They can be both positive and negative. Common beneftis are
- Reduction of emission
- Increase/decrease in noise pollution
- Reduction in traffic
- ...

### Common methods to assess externalities

## Net Present Value (NPV)

**Net Present Value** indicates in monetary terms the current value of the net benefits that occur throughout the period studied contrasted with the initial costs.

$$
NPV = -I_{0} + \sum\limits_{t=1}^{n} \frac{B_{t}}{(1+r)^{t}} - \sum\limits_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C_{t}}{(1+r)^{t}}
$$
where:
- $I_{0}:$ Initial investment of the project
- $B_{t}:$ Profits of the project in period (year) $t$
- $C_{t}:$ Costs of the project in period (year) $t$
- $r:$ Discount rate (In EU, usually 3%)
- $n:$ Number of periods (years) for which the analysis is done

In the definition above, the initial investment is considered in year 0.

- [?] Shouldn't $t$ start from 0 in the benefits, if there are benefits even in the year of the initial investment?

A project is considered viable if $NVP >0$.

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

The discount rate in the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/02 - Appraisal and Cost-Benefit Analysis - DME#Net Present Value (NPV)\|#Net Present Value (NPV)]] calculation can influence whether a project is considered viable or not. So, sometimes it is useful to calculate the discount rate such that the NPV is 0.

The **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** is the discount rate such that the [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/02 - Appraisal and Cost-Benefit Analysis - DME#Net Present Value (NPV)\|#Net Present Value (NPV)]] is 0:
$$
0 = -I_{0} + \sum\limits_{t=1}^{n} \frac{B_{t}-C_{t}}{(1+IRR)^{t}}
$$
