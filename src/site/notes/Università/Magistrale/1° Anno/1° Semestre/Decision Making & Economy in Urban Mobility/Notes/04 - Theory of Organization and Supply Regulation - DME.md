## Integration or fragmentation

### Levels of organization

Every transportation system can be thought of being made up of 3 levels:
- [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/1° Semestre/Decision Making & Economy in Urban Mobility/Notes/04 - Theory of Organization and Supply Regulation - DME#Infrastructure level\|#Infrastructure level]]
- [[#Info structure level]]
- [[#Service level]]


#### Infrastructure level

```ad-Definizione
title: Infrastructure level

The **infrastructure level** is the most material and physical part of a transportation system

```

- In a road, the infrastructure would be the road itself
- In a railway, the infrastructure would be the rail tracks, the ballast,...


#### Info structure level

```ad-Definizione
title: Info structure

The **info structure** is the part of the transportation system that ensures the safe and optimized use of the [[#Infrastructure level]].

```

It could be:
- Traffic signaling on roads
- Signaling on rails
- Air traffic control
- ...


#### Service level

```ad-Definizione
title: Service level

The **service level** is the part of a transportation system that touch the final consumer. It's what it purchased by the final consumer and is characterized by price, frequency and quality of service.

```

### Coordination

The 3 [[#Levels of organization]] can be articulated in several ways.
- Each level is managed by different operators
- Same operators for 2 f the 3 individual levels
- Different enterprises working together

## Perfect and imperfect competition

### Perfect competition

```ad-Definizione
title: Perfect competition

A market with perfect competition has to meet the following criteria:
- No one has market power - Price is defined by the market
- All competitors and user have perfect information
- Markets are complete (there is a market for each good and consumers willing to pay the marginal cost of producing them)
- Markets are flexible

In a perfect competition, there are infinitly many agents all infinitly small.
```

In reality though, there usually only is [[#Imperfect competition]]

### Imperfect competition

Imperfect competition is one where there is no [[#Perfect competition]]. There can be 3 types of imperfect competition:


#### Monopolistic competition

```ad-Definizione
title: Monopolistic competition

In a **monopolistic competition** there are several agents making the same product but each have they're unique characteristic. (ex: many companies making phones, but the phones are all different).

```


#### Oligopoly

```ad-Definizione
title: Oligopoly

In a **oligopoly** there are only a few agents providing the same product or service.

(ex. Car companies, regional airlines,...)

```


#### Monopoly

```ad-Definizione
title: Monopoly

In a **monopoly**, there is only 1 single agent providing one product or service

```
