# [[Università/Magistrale/1° Anno/Data Analysis in Transport Systems/Notes/02.1 - Input Data Analysis - DATS\|02.1 - Input Data Analysis - DATS]]


In stochastic simulations, we must decide on input probability distributions from which to generate random variables:
- Random variables = observation or draws or realizations of a random variables from specified input distributions/processes
- Queueing systems: interarrival and service times

Once those input probability distributions are specified, must have a way to generate random variates from them


### Specifying Univariate Input Distributions

- Univariate distribution: a single (scalar) random input
	- May have many across simulation
- Typically have real-world observed data on a simulation input
	- Want to fit a probability distribution to the data
	- Then use this fitted distribution to generate random variates to drive the simulation
- Why not just drive simulation with actual observed data?
	- Seems more direct than fitting/generation
	- Useful for validation, but there are problems

### Choosing Probability Distributions

Continous
- Normal
- Exponential
- Logistic
- Uniform
- (Triangular) - not in the assgn
- Weibull
- Gamma
- Pareto
- Lognormal
- Loglogistic
- Erlang k
- Gumbel
- etc.

Discrete:
- Discrete uniform
- Binomial
- Poisson
- Geometric
- Negative
- Binomial

See slides for useful books/links.

- Take a look at the data
	- Are numbers real or integers
	- Look at the range (negative and positive, just positive,...) - we can discart distribution
- Make a histogram
	- Match it to a subset of possible distribution of real data

### Fitting distribution to data
