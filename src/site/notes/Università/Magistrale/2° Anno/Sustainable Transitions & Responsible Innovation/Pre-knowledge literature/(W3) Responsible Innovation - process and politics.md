```ad-Definizione
title: Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
**Responsible Research and Innovation** is a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products (in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our society).

(Von Schomberg, 2012, p. 50)
