![[Arnstein S. - A Ladder Of Citizen Participation - STRI.pdf]]

Participation is, in theory, the **cornerstone of democracy**.

## Citizen participation is citizen power

```ad-Definizione
title: Citizen participation

**Citizen participation** is a categorical term for citizen power. It is the redistribution of power that enables the have-not citizens, presently excluded from the political and economic processes, to be deliberately included in the future.

```

### Empty ritual versus benefit

![Participation - Empty ritual versus benefit.jpg](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/2%C2%B0%20Anno/Sustainable%20Transitions%20&%20Responsible%20Innovation/Pre-knowledge%20literature/Allegati/Participation%20-%20Empty%20ritual%20versus%20benefit.jpg)

Participation without redistribution of power is an empty and frustrating process for the powerless.

### Types of participation and non-participation

We can distinguish 8 levels of participation. They are ordered from less influence/power to more influence/power:
1. [[#Manipulation]]
2. [[#Therapy]]
3. [[#Informing]]
4. [[#Consultation]]
5. [[#Placation]]
6. [[#Partnership]]
7. [[#Delegated power]]
8. [[#Citizen control]]

Some are basically non-participation ([[#Manipulation]] and [[#Therapy]]): citizens don't really have any power, they are just being educated or cured by power-holders.

Some are considered levels of **tokenism** ([[#Informing]], [[#Consultation]], [[#Placation]]): have-nots (citizens, participants) are allowed to hear and be heard but they lack the power to ensure that their views will be taken into account.

Finally, we find levels that actually give power to the participants in the decision-making process ([[#Partnership]], [[#Delegated power]], [[#Citizen control]]).

They can all be arranged on a ladder, representing the amount of influence/power they have:
