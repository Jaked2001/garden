[[Technology]]: It's the Knowledge/methods embedded in objects we use

Is technology enough to solve problems?
- We need technology
- We also need behavioural change
	- Society is giving meaning to technology

### Dilemmas

Every technology implementation brings with it dilemmas.

Now we are collecting a lot of data. What if the data is leaked.

What are the implications of using new technologies?

### Societal challenges

Expresses a problem that is experienced by a bigger part of society.

The common demonitor is that they are 
- complex
- nonlinear
- uncertain
- value-laden
	- Not every one perceive these challenges as challenges
- locally conceived, globally manifested

Necessity to talk to people, to be in a dialogue. If we consult people about their problems, there is a chance that we can come up with a better solution.


Up to now, we've been saying that **innovation is needed for economic growth**. Now we realiaze that we did it at the cost of our environment.

What is the goal of innovation? Do we solely innovate for economic growth? Also for sustainability?

**SOCIO-TECHNICAL EXPERIMENTATION:**
Testing the proposal in a village, with real people. Testing things out in real life.

## Sustainability Transitions

### System Innovation

![Schermata 2025-09-02 alle 11.45.17.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/2%C2%B0%20Anno/Sustainable%20Transitions%20&%20Responsible%20Innovation/Teoria/Allegati/Schermata%202025-09-02%20alle%2011.45.17.png)

System change is often called a **transition**.
```ad-Definizione
title: Sustainability transitions

Going from the status quo (Incumbent regime) to a new regime where we can keep functioning 

```

Broad context (landscape) --> these are the big trends/developments/shocks (war, price change on oil...): they often provide opportunities, making space for new alternatives that can allow for a new regime.

![Schermata 2025-09-02 alle 11.54.44.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/2%C2%B0%20Anno/Sustainable%20Transitions%20&%20Responsible%20Innovation/Teoria/Allegati/Schermata%202025-09-02%20alle%2011.54.44.png)

In the incumbent regime:
- Power play
- Conflicts and contestations

How do we involve users?

Not always the best solutions wins. What wins is the solution that has the most votes.

There are always winners and losers

### Strategic Niche Management

How do we support niches?
1. Shielding
2. Nurturing
	- Feed the niche. Make sure that a lot of people like it and use it
3. Empowering
	- How do you navigate your way in a system that works in a completely different way

### System vs regime

Regime is a logic.
A practice that is embedded into us.

- Uniform, homogeneus, universal
- Complete
- Stabilised
- Single
- Obdurate (immune to change and influence)
- Role of formal institutions
- Trust, political legitimacy, democracy

Regime is the dominant way of doing things, but it doesn't mean they are structured or organized.

Regimes have a lot of momentum (inertia).

**Path-dependence**: The past decisions will influence the future decisions.
**Lock-in**: You cannot get out of a certain regime.
