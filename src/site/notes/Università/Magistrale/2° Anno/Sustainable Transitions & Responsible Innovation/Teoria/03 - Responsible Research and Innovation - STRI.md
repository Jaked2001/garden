[[Johanna Höffken]]

It's a framework, a critique...

- Brief recap and positioning
- Steering science and innovation - some basic thoughts
- The emergence of RRI in the EU context
- The RRI - AIRR framework
- A few deepening thoughts on RRI

## Re-cap and positioning

We've talked about stability and change before. Today we are zooming in in this.

We will unpack the role of **Research** and **Innovation**. We also look at the question of **responsabiity**.

Why should we look at responsible research and innovation?

It plays a huge role in bringing on change. One leverage for change is research and innovation.

- Are research and innovation processes and outcomes neutral? Can we steer them?
- Who is responsible for the processes and outcomes of research and innovation?

## Steering science and innovation - some basic thoughts

### Science, technology and innovation in shaping our futures

Science and technology and innovations have the power to create futures and vulnerabilities.

It's important to adknowledge this:

### Science, technology and innovation are political artifacts

They are socially, environmentally, politically and ethically entangled.

Ivory tower of science: "Scientists feel like they are up there and want to keep politics out of their ivory tower". They try to keep objective and rational search for truth. Science advances only by essentially unpredictable steps, pursuing problems of its own.

A reason why science and techonlogy should not be at the top of the ivory tower, is that they are today the engine of the market and darling of the knowledge economy.

### Technoscience and innovation can have unintended consequences

They have uncertain and unpredictable impacts.

Examples:
- Social media and mental health
- Automation, AI and job replacement
- Geo-engineering
- E-waste

**Consequentialist** approach to science and technology.

### Collingridge dilemma (The dilemma of control)


When change is easy, the need for it cannot be foreseen; when the need for change is apparent, change has become expensive, difficult and time consuming.

- Information problem
- Power problem

```ad-example

???
```

I early stages it's easy to change. Once the technology is developed, it's easy to loose control.

### Consequentialist approach to science and innovation

Try so solve the problem when it comes up, not at the beginning.

Succumb to moral luck:
- Hoping that with the benefit of hindsight reasonable foreseeability cannot be proven
- Hoping not to be confronted byt the ???

**Lines of accountability are not easily drawn** between actions and consequences. This discounting of the future may appear attractive and pragmatic

It's morally troubling to do this:
- Undermines fairness for holding someone accountable
- Similar actions can be judged differently based on outcomes influenced by luck
- Can erode trust in the moral and legal system

### Governance through the tenet of the market-choice

Market thinking is very keen in pushing science and technology.
Innovation implies the creation of value from ideas in a free-market economy.

Market is viewed as being best placed to direct goods and services to their most desirable end use.

Profitability as key criterion for market-driven innovation.

What happens to innovation which is deemed insufficiently profitable?
- Neglected
- Left to the state
- Or to philantropy

There are other ways of innovation:
- Social innovation
- B corps movement
- Innovation aimed at the bottom of the pyramid

Aim to combine innovation as a profit-driven, competitive, market-based activity with the co-production of **social goods**.

## The emergence of RRI in the EU context

[[Commissione Europea|European Commission]] (EC) (not elected by us). It has the right to propose new laws and regulations...

A content of the EC is Research and Innovation.

According to EU:
```ad-Definizione
title: Responsible Research and Innovation

RRI It's an approach that anticipates and assesses potential implications and societal expectations with regard to research and innovation, with the aim to foster the design of inclusive and sustainable research and innovation.

```

It's into a funding program. 

RRI is a cross-cutting policy: it goes into a lot of fields. Examples:
- promoting science communication
- open access
- gender equality in sicence
- ethical dimension
- ...

RRI is the end product of several decades of social science and humanities research in the broad areas of:
- Science and communication
- public engagement
- technology assessment
- and user led design

RRI builds on traditions such as science technology studies and ethics of techology

RRI builds on technology assessment (TA)

ELSA: Etjhical, Legal and Social Aspects

It combines many different strands in the social sciences.


There are a ton of different approaches, form different people on how to approach RRI. You can se it for:
- Articulation
- Interpretation
- Assessment
- Intervention

It aims to tackle the problems of steering research and innovation.

**RRI is a future-oriented appraoch** It allows for:
- Greater potential to accomodate uncertainty
- Reflection on purpose and values

Shift to collective responsability:
- From individual, consequentialist responsability
- To collective process - and outcome - oriented responsabiity

Responsability as responsible **process** and responsible **outcome**.

We also look at the process of how we innovate.

this means engaging more people:
- Policy makers
- research community
- education community
- business 

```ad-Definizione
title: Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
**Responsible Research and Innovation** is a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products (in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our society).

(Von Schomberg, 2012, p. 50)

```

It's based on perspective notion.



## The RRI - AIRR framework

AIRR: it has 4 dimensions.

It's a framework for doing RRI.
- [[#Anticipation]]
- [[#Reflexivity]]
- [[#Inclusion]]
- [[#Responsiveness]]

### 4 dimensions

#### Anticipation

Asking **WHAT IF?** questions. Aimed at increasing resilience.

#### Reflexivity

- Holding a mirror up to one's own activities, commitments and assumptions.
- Recognizing limits of knowledge.
- Particular framing may not be held universally.

#### Inclusion

Inclusions of new voices. It's about **engagement**. hear more voices, in the search of **legitimacy**.

Enable public debate to take place upstream in the scientific and technological process.

#### Responsiveness

Respond:
- to react and to answer
Capacity to change shape or direction in response to stakeholder and public values and changing circumstances.

## A few deepening thoughts on RRI

RRI looks not so much at the structure. It puts a lot of focus on innovators

**It's change WITHIN the system, not OF the system**.

DOn't need to change the institutional contet in which innovations are pursued. 
CRITIQUE:
- RRI might have rather conformist nature
- RRI approaches see responsibility as subservient to ecconomic growth and industrial success

### Responsiveness: agenda setting

We've said [[#Responsiveness]] should not only be about changing circumstances but also in terms of setting and framing of the policy agendas and challenges technoscience and innovation should address.

Focus on governance of intent is contested. Challenges principles of market governance and scientific autonomy.

Should we control or keep free.
