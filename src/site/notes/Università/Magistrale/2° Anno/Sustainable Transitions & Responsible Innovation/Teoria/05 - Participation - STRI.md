- [?] How do you use participation in innovative projects that try to break the status quo? Down to earth example: trying to build active mobility infrastructure in a car centric city. This requires to take away car capacity, parking etc. Also, benefits will not be instantaneous: To achieve true modal shift, for example, a full network of bike lanes is necessary, one corridor is not enough. This takes time. How can we use a participatory process in this context withtout it backfiring and stopping the project all together, not because it's not valid or needed, but because it's hard for people to understand what could be?
- [?] What are good communication strategies? How do we make sure that people are actually attracted to participate? I can think of examples were participatory processes were put in place but the way they were presented they seemed to call only for people interested in the topic in the first place ([[GRAB\|GRAB]] exposition at museum)

# Lecture

Some **values**:
- Equality
- Money
- Justice
- Privacy
- Sustainability
- ...

On these level of abstraction, most people agree on these values. But people disagree on how we define them.

You want the ideal politician to have both **power** and **values**.

## Ethics

Systematic reflection on what is a good or bad action.

Some theories:
- **Deontology**: The old deontology system just gives a list of things you're not supposed to do.
	- The most important thing is the *action*
- **Consequentialism**: The consequences that our actions have on life. Maximise the greatest benefit of the greatest number (Cost benefit analysis)
	- Maximise happiness for the greatest number
	- !! It allows for some individuals to be not happy at all
		- You are not concerned about the distribution
- ???

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Explain how the world works.: including nasty thinkgs like power, inequality, exploitation, wars, neo-colonialism | How the world **should** be: normative perspective     |
| Why the (social) world is, as it is (descriptive/explanatory science)                                             | Not how individuals behave, but how they should behave |

## The ideal of participation and deliberation

Why is it bad?
- Can dampen decisive actions: 
- Not effective: may delay or replace actions
- Not every body may be informed enough for the decision
- Whom to include?
Why is it good?
- Gains support for a project
- Increases transparency
- People feel ownership
- Increases total knowledge
- Mutual justification: democracy should as much as possible to jointly decide

## Justice

???

- (Intrinsic good). including people in decision making is a good thinkg in itself
- (Instrumental good). Including people in decision making leads to better outcome

Strong belief in the power of **reason**:
- we should we able to come to a mutual agreement using reason

Reason tells you 2 things:
- **Rational**: choose the mans towards your ends knowing how: How do I get to what I want
- **Reason/Wisdom**: telling you what you should or should not do


### Autonomy and freedom

From status to contract.

A slow shift was found in roman law: 
from *rights depend on who you are*.

Rules of society should be such that they grant equal status to all members.

**Western individualism**: the individual has a moral value:
- Other values must be explained/justified from the perspective of the individual (values)
- Projection of human rights (equality)
- What about the value of nature, value of social relation? Can the social good be reduced to individual interest?

2 ways to approach the social good:
- Start with social values (what's the greater good, the common good)
- Start with the value of the individual

Idea of liberal democracy:
- Decision should be supported by majority vote
- Protection of fundamental rights of individuals

‼️ Letting the majority decide, can be detrimental to the rights of individuals.

## Linking justice and participation

### The social contract

Joint idea:
- Can we derive social principles o the justice of basic social structures from the starting point of (egoisyic) human beings that want to interact with each other, such that this interaction is beneficial for each individual?
- Base morality on the idea of social contract


### Rawls: Original Position

The original position is a hypothetical situation, that is part of a thought experiment:
Suppose to form a new society:
- We don't know which person we would be in that society.
- Which rules would we agree upon?

Rawls' solution:
- Basic rights should be distrivuted equally, everybody has the same rights
- Goods can be distributed unequally
	- If and only if this leads to a greater net-benefit than equal distribution (utilitarian maximisation)
	- AND the worst off in this society are better off thean the worst of in society with a more equal distribution of goods
	- AND if everybody has an equal opportunity to achieve a fair share of the goods

Structure participation so that is more likely to bring to a good outcome.
