```table-of-contents

## Systems. Why?

- Societal challenges require a constellation of innovations
- Controversies often exceed single innovations
- A broader analysis is needed

Socio-technical systems consist of configurations: actors, technologies, institutions, and interactions

These actors interact, compete, collaborate... These take place inside certain technological domains.

## Sustainability transitions

The sustainability Transitions usially implies:
- Destabilisation phase
- Build up phase

### Multi-level perspective

1. Landscape level
	- **Stable** Public values, policies...
2. Regime level
	- The dominant way of doing things
3. Niche level
	- Things that try to challenge the existing system and eventually become normant

## Directionality

Transitions are not driven by a single innovation, rather by a constellation of innovations.

There are sometimes competing or alternative solutions. 

It isn't neutral: normative, political

It has major moral implications
- Creative destruction of markets
- Winners and losers
- Power shifts


## Embracing contestation with reflexive governance

- 1st order reflexivity: What can I do to do better
- 2nd order: What do I understand by sustainability in the first place?
