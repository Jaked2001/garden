# [[Università/Magistrale/2° Anno/Q1/Sustainable Transitions & Responsible Innovation/Case-Study/W6 - Environmental Justice - STRI\|W6 - Environmental Justice - STRI]]

In this assignment you apply Environmental Justice to identify justice issues in the implementation of your chosen technology in a real life context (experiment). Based on your assessment, you provide suggestions for improvement.
- Identify an existing transition experiment
- Use the building blocks based on the 5 dimensions of Environmental Justice to analyse justice issues within the transition experiment (slides 58-62)
	- Structure: justice issues (not a fill-in exercise)
- Provide suggestions for making the experiment more just (not per dimension, but integrated recommendations!)

Transition experiment: "an inclusive, practice-based and challenge-led initiative designed to promote system innovation through social learning under conditions of uncertainty and abiguity" (Sengers et al., 2019)

Show in your analysis how the justice dimensions are interrelated! (Do not distribute the dimensions among your goup!)
