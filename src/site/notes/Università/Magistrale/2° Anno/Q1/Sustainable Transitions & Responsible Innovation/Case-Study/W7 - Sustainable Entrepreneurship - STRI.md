1. Identify a company that is a stakeholder in your case (Alternative: a relevant company in the area of your case)
2. How does the company present itself? (You can use their internet page, their report on Corporate Social Responsibility, interviews / statements from company members, etc.)
3. How do other stakeholders see the company? Would they come to a different conclusion? Support your statements with sources (e.g. newspaper articles, journal articles, blogposts, etc.)
4. Give your judgment: where would you, as a group, place the company within the typology of moral development and why?
