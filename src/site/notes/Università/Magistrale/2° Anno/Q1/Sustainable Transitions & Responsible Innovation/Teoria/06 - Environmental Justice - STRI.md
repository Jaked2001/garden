## Why do we need just transitions?

- Transitions have the potential to create or reinforce injustices
- Importance of governance processes in transitions:
	- Who is part of governance processes and experiments???
	- Who wins and who loses?

[[(W6) - Justice in Energy Transitions|(Williams & Doyon, 2019)]]
- From a **normative standpoint**, unjust transitions are not sustainable.
- From an **instrumental standpoint**, injustice erodes political support and social acceptance for transitions

What are the risks of not incorporating justice? There are many answers provided by [[(W6) - Justice in Energy Transitions|(Williams & Doyon, 2019)]]:
- Availability and affordability
- focus on costs and risks rather than benefits
- lack of public support
- exclusion of stakeholders
- growing support for populist movements that reject transitions
- sub-optimal decisions due to exclusion knowledge of excluded stakeholders
- mismatch innovations/solutions with excluded stakeholders

How to overcome these risks?
- Consider transitions as opportunities for teh transformation of unjust socio-technical systems
- Design fair and inclusive participatory processes
- Provide space for dissenting views and voices
- Recognise diversity of needs and identities of people and communities

```ad-Definizione
title: Justice

Justice is not about how people are treated (legal rights), but also gow the venefits and burdes of societal activities are distributed ([[Distributive justice]]) and how this distribution is decided upon ([[Procedural justice]]).
```

- Environmental justice:
- Social justice
- climate justice
- energy justice
- mobility justice
- flexibility justice
- data justice

Based on the approach or framework we use we can distinguish ([[(W6) - Justice in Energy Transitions|(Williams & Doyon, 2019)]]):
- Distributive justice
- procedural justice
- justice as recognition
Or [[(W6) - When Does Unequal become Unfair? Judging Claims of Environmental Injustice|(Davoudi & Brooks, 2014)]]:
- distribution
- recognition
- participation
- responsibility
- capabilities

## The 5 lenses of justice

### Distribution

**Who gets what**

Most people agree that "a just society is one in which everyone receives a *fair* share of the available resources", but there is much disagreement on what counts as *fair*.

3 main theories can be listed:
- [[Egalitarianism]]: *Equality* - everyone should receive the same amount regardless of their input or need
- [[Libertarianism]]: *Equity* - what people receive from society should be based on what they contribute to it
- [[Utilitarianism\|Utilitarianism]]: *Welfare* - what people receive should be based on their needs

Environmental Justice (EJ) has moved beyond pollution and toxic waste to incorporate the distributional patterns of an expansive range of both *environmental bads* and *environmental goods*



### Recognition

**Who counts?**

We should not ignore *cultural and institutional processes and legacies* that have explicitly or implicitly given individuals, communities, or social groups unequal recognition.

Recognition is about equality in differences. It questions how can justice be blind to difference and treat everyone equally while at the same time recognising people's different identities and vulnerabilities.

It's about understanding the differences of those affected by a particular distribution of goods and bads

### Participation

**Who gets heard?**

Justice is not only about sharing resources but also about **joining the debate** about what that sharing involves an how it should be managed.

See [[05 - Participation - STRI]].

### Capabilities

**What matters?**

```ad-quote
Environmental burdens and benefits have a profound impact on people’s capabilities. They can enable or inhibit their ability to convert other goods to well-being and freedom to function in ways that they have reason to value.
```

It's about concentrating on **actual opportunities** rather than the means of living.

On such a basis, justice is **not** focused on individuals' happiness or pleasure ([[Utilitarianism]]) or their income and wealth (resource based approach), but on their **freedom** and **capabilities**.

Justice is the capacity of people to function in the lives they choose for themselves.

Capability concerns the equal distribution of the capacities that people need for leading a life of their own design.

Interesting questions to ask:
- Does the environmental burden limit or increase the freedom of people to pursue their valued goals?
- What do the costs, benefits, and risks mean for different stakeholders?
- Are affected people or communities particularly vulnerable for the impacts of (environmental) burdens?
- Can the end-users bear risk? Do they want to?
- Under which conditions could the distribution be acceptable (trade-offs, performance requirements, etc.)?

### Responsibility

**Who does what?**

Obligations and responsibilities are central to any account of justice because being subjected to the harms in which we have had no choice  or responsibility reinforces people's sense of injustice.

In environmental justice, we have to raise the issue of not only identifying responsibility towards humans, but also nonhuman nature. There is little attention to the latter, as usually the literature tends to have an anthropocentric view of the world. 

We can distinguish **instrumental** (nature for human's sake) and **moral** (nature for nature's sake) reasons for taking responsibility for the environment.
