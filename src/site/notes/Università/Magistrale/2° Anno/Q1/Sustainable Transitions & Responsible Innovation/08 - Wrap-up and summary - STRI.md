![[L8 - Wrap-up and Summary - Slides - STRI.pdf]]

- Text and interpret
- Own case: apply something new
- "Discuss": more elaborate arguments
- It's not about the length, but about the arguments being made

## Institutional Entrepreneurship

[[Università/Magistrale/2° Anno/Q1/Sustainable Transitions & Responsible Innovation/Teoria/02 - Institutional Entrepreneurship - STRI\|02 - Institutional Entrepreneurship - STRI]]

Questions:
- What is something
- Can you apply to a case
- Can you read a text and say who is the institutional entrepreneur in that context?
- not reproduction of knowledge
## Responsible Research and Innovation

- RRI is an academic and a policy debate
- Steering science and innovation is a key problem, rationale and question in RRI
- The AIRR framework is a key framework
- RRI & its deepening thoughts

Anticipation, inclusion, reflexivity, responsiveness

Questions:
- Not interested in the definition of those words
- More interested in broader debate

## Environmental Justice Framework

Justice is not only about how people are treated (legal rights), but also how the benefits and burdens of societal activities are distributed (distributive justice) and how this distribution is decided upon (procedural justice)

 - Students must be able to explain why justice is relevant for sustainability transitions.
 - Explain and apply 5 justice dimensions
 - Explain how these 5 dimensions relate to each other and come to overarching conclusions / synthesis (rather than ticking the boxes and considering it a fill in exercise)

## Participation and co-creation

[[Università/Magistrale/2° Anno/Q1/Sustainable Transitions & Responsible Innovation/Teoria/05 - Participation - STRI\|05 - Participation - STRI]]
- Advantages and disadvantages


Fung:
- Scope of participation
- Mode of communication and decision
- Extent of authority

Maybe the type of participation you want to choose, depends on the type of problem you are trying to solve.

## Business ethics

Goodpaster: how ethics work in individuals and, since corporations are often seen as persons, how ethics work for them.

- Type 1: conscience as a guide to self-interest
- Type 2: conscience as a systemic variant: 2a invisibile hand pattern, market forces and 2b visible hand pattern, legal constraints
- Type 3: conscience as an authoritative guide

if you are willing to violate the law you are up to 2a. Clearly not 2b

## Reflection

- Did the combination of frameworks and themes help you understand the case?
- Could you identify barriers and opportunities to sustainable innovation in a responsible way?
- Which theme was most interesting?
- Which frameworks showed relevant issues?
- What did you miss?
- What was relevant but not uncovered?
