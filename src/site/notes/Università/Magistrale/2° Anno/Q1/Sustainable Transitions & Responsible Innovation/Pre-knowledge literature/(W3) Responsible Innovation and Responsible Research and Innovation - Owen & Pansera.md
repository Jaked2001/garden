RRI is born the European Commission, differently from RI

```ad-Definizione
title: Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
**Responsible Research and Innovation** is a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products (in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our society).

(Von Schomberg, 2012, p. 50)

```


The European Commission RRI is divided in 5 keys:
 - **Public engagement** (connected to RI [[Università/Magistrale/2° Anno/Q1/Sustainable Transitions & Responsible Innovation/Pre-knowledge literature/(W3) Developing a framework for responsible innovation#Inclusion\|Inclusion]])
 - **Open access/Open science** (aligned with RI **openess**)
 - **Gender** (RI doesn't have gender, but has [[Università/Magistrale/2° Anno/Q1/Sustainable Transitions & Responsible Innovation/Pre-knowledge literature/(W3) Developing a framework for responsible innovation#Inclusion\|Inclusion]])
 - **Science education**: making science more attractive to young people (RI focuses on multidisciplinary approach)
 - **Ethics**: Applying established ethical principles. (RI advocates [[Università/Magistrale/2° Anno/Q1/Sustainable Transitions & Responsible Innovation/Pre-knowledge literature/(W3) Developing a framework for responsible innovation#Reflexivity\|Reflexivity]] on ethical issues)

In practice, RRI from EC appears to be more a set of themes.
