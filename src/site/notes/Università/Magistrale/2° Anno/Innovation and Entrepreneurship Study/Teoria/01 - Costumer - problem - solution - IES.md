# [[Università/Magistrale/2° Anno/Innovation and Entrepreneurship Study/Teoria/01 - Costumer - problem - solution - IES\|01 - Costumer - problem - solution - IES]]

```table-of-contents
```

Start looking at one challenge of any given topic.

Start from a **need**, a **pain**.

## Who for?

First target.

**Customer:**
- Clearly identified
- Reached
- Met, talked, lived with
- Sold the not yet existent

**Problem:**
- Set, made it clear to customer
- Priority ranking for customer
- Current solution

How to quantify:
- Direct numbers
- Proxy

**Solution:**
- Found
- Degree of problem solved
- made it clear
- validated with customer

### Where to look for

What am I able to do? Can I excel in something?
What am I passionate about?
Are you adding **value** (time, quality of life, money,...) for someone? Are you making somebody's life better?

Focus on **business** not simply on **technology**.

Keep in mind the financial sustainability. This is the cake, the rest is the cherry on top of the cake.


**COSTUMER:** the one to whom you are adding value
**PROBLEM:** the unspoken need
**SOLUTION:** Does your idea solve the problem=

```ad-example
title: Walkman

Walkmen could only host a couple of CDs

Solution: the **iPod**

```


14 words to describe what's the need for the solution you're proposing

# The challenges:

## YoungPolymer

- [?] Difference between the mentioned bio-polymers?

Decomposes really quickly.
Low cost
Very scalable

Technology is not new, but is not industrial level yet.


- 2-3€/kg
- Normal bio-plastics 7€/kg
- [?] Price of normal plastics?


Material proprierties enable what kind of plastics?

When did you start? End of this year
Have subsidies for prototype.
How big is the team? Only part-time people

This plastic is not recyclable. 

PHA: quite brittle (similar to PLA). 

Take the carbon out of the air to produce.


## DAF autonomous trucks

- [?] Don't many drivers own their own truck and are self employed? Do you see this disappearing?

Last year idea: automated valet parking app for trucks. It's a big issue for drivers to find parking space

Want to identify:
- Value chain:
- If the track needs to charge, what happens
- Identify challenges of putting autonomous tracks on the road

best case: long distance hub to hub because it's hard to find drivers willing to drive these long distances and they require higher pay.



## Iron Power Technology

- [?] What is patented? Isn't electrolysis a simple process? Is it the process in large scale that is patented?
	- [ ] The specific technology needed to make iron is what is patented.
- [?] How do you go from powder to iron?
- [?] Is there a difference in quality to normal methods of doing iron like this?
	- [ ] The produced iron is high purity in the form of powder. Not really needed for steel, more needed for 3D printing

Find a unique business model.

Past the proof of concept. It works at lab scale.




## More movements

For physiotherapy, it can help in doing exercise by yourself making sure you're doing it right.

Still need to implement a filter to isolate the subject

Right now focusing on the physiotherapy market.



## Photonics Integrated Circuits

similar to electronic integrated circuits.

They work with light:

Good for:
- Communication (think optical fiber)
- Sensing
- Computing

- [?] Do they suffer less radiation, interference...?
	- 


Electrical circuit is built layer by layer.

It has to guide light. 

Recognize materials, sort plastic.


Biggest problem is the production: not available in the market.



## Volcycle

What happens to solar panels at the end of their 25/30 years lives?

Works on pyrolysis technology to recycle materials in solar panels (like silver and silicon).
