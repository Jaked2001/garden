# [[Università/Magistrale/2° Anno/Innovation and Entrepreneurship Study/Teoria/01.1 - Technology Delta and Barriers - IES\|01.1 - Technology Delta and Barriers - IES]]

```table-of-contents
```

Steps:
- Introduction
- Penetration
- Mass market

## Introduction

```ad-Definizione
title: Technology Delta

How much better the new technology is compared to the one we are currently use.

```

The larger the technology delta is, the more we can encourage change.

Can it be estimated? Some things, yes, like performance. The impact, not really.

Timing parameters:
- Tech delta
- Barriers
- Dynamics
- Megatrends
- Tech trends

```ad-quote

Technology is the answer, but what was the question?
```

If new technology  is a missing piece in existing technology value chain, it might be extremely valuable.

## The hype cycle

Optimistic to pessimistic view. Then realistic, more based on facts.

Several steps:
- Innovation trigger
- Peak of inflated expectations
- Trough of disillusionment
- Slope of enlightenment
- Plateau of productivity - established technologies

Some technologies never make it into the curve but still have a huge potential.

The hypes of technologies are always debated and we can use these debates.

## Barriers to change and diffusion

Barriers can be found in many areas. The main ones are:
- legal framework
- Standardisation
- Trust
- Infrastructure
- Business model
- Critical mass
- Proof of concept
- Business ecosystem

### Legal framework

It's slow to change. We have to adapt to it.

### Standardisation

Standardisation.
Without it, many technologies have a hard time growing and developing.
### Trust

It's a matter of **perseption**. Takes a long time to build, and can be lost in a second.

### Infrastructure

Needed for many new technologies. The technology is good, but the surrounding infrastructure is missing

### Business model

There has to be value creation for every player.

### Critical mass

If critical mass is not reached, diffusion is not reached. If a technology needs a volume to exist, it could get stuck. For example, we all need to have phones, for phones to be useful.

### Proof of concept

If no one is ready to jump on board at early stages, there will never be new customers.

### Business ecosystem

Sometimes it takes time to build
