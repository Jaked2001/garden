There seems to be some sort of correlation between innovation and economic growth.

Is technology driving new needs, or are new needs promoting the development of technology?

It's probably a never ending cycle.

# Dynamics of Innovation

Designs of products tend all to the same standard.

Where the 2 lines cross, is were desing become standard. 

```ad-example

The QWERTY keyboard layout is the same as that of typewriters.

```

Moving from one S curve to an other, corresponds usually to a change in leadrship in industry (see Apple after Nokia),

```ad-quote

# Diffusion of Innovation
There is a lot of resistance to take on new technologies.

Factors explaining adoption rate:
- Relative advantage
- Compatibility
- Simplicity
- Trialability
- Observability



# Disruptive Innovation


```ad-example

- Digital photography
- Computers
- News vs Newspapers
- Low-cost airlines
```

Old players now struggle or are completely out of business



## Categorization of innovations

### By origin/type

- Product
- Process
- Market
- Organization

### By impact

- Sustaining
	- Incremental
	- Radical (or breakthrough)
- Transformational (or disruptive)


# A wider perspective

- [[#Dynamics of Innovation]]
- [[#Diffusion of Innovation]]
- [[#Disruptive Innovation]]

We need to look beyond a single market or perspective.
