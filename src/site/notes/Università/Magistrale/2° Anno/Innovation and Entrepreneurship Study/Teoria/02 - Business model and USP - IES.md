## What is a business model?

```ad-Definizione
title: Business Model

Possible definitions of a **Business Model**

The logic that connects technical potential eith the realization of economic value (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002)

It describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and capture value ([[Forbes\|Forbes]])

It describes the rationale of how an organization *creates*, *delivers* and *capture value* starting from an *idea* (Osterwalder)

It delivers to **customers** and captures value starting from an idea (Filippas)

```

There is a difference between customer and beneficiary:
ex: 

```ad-example

books for kids have a colorful cover and a back explaining parents what books is for

**Health products:** beneficiary is the patient, but customer is insurance
```

In these examples, we have to find a [[value proposition\|value proposition]] for both sides.


From technical domain (feasbility, performance) leads to economic domain (Value, price, profit). The business model is connecting these two domains.

A BM assumes how a firm will create, capture and delivers value to customers connnecting technology and economic value.

BM is focused predomintely on **[[value proposition\|value proposition]]**.

For whom we are doing this, affects the solution or the product.

[[Value Network\|Value Network]]: there are more stakeholders than the main beneficiary. Who are **all** the stakeholders. 

### How to craft a BM

- [[Customer segment\|Customer segment]]:
	- Whose pain do we address?
	- for whom do we create value?
	- who is our customer?
- [[Value proposition\|Value proposition]]:
	- what do we deliver to the customer?
	- which problems are we helping to address?
	- **No pain no gain**
- Channels:
	- How do we reach the customer?
	- How is our value delivered?
	- How are distribution and sales channels organized?
- Customer relationship:
	- How do I get the customers feedback?
	- What are customer expectations in interacting with us?
	- What interaction are needed?
Customers need to be profiled as accuratly as possible.

- Revenue Stream: For what value are our customer willing to pay? For what are they paying? How are they willing to pay?

A way to do this, is to see how much are others doing this for and for what price.

- **Key resources:**
	- What are necessary resources to realize and distribute value to customers and collect revenue?
	- People, companies, raw materials...
- **Key activities:**
	- what are the activities required for our value proposition? Customer? Distribution Channels?
- **Key partnerships:**
	- Who are key partners to conduct activities?
	- What key resources/activities do they perform?
- **Cost structure:** 
	- What are the most inherent costs in our BM?
	- Who are the most expensive resources and partners?

Remember the **transaction cost**. the cost of changing a service, product or whatever, for the customer. Ex: When switching phone provider, I'm not doing it if I have to change my phone number

TOOLS:
- Business model canvas (Lean Canvas)
- Context map canvas


### How important is a business model?

A mediocre technology pursued within a great business model may be more valuable than a great technology exploited ...???

### Contextualization thanks to Business Model

We need to go from the conceptual to the concrete.

We need to get closer and closer to a precise segment where we can address the problem.

To do this, we need a [[Unique Selling Propositions\|Unique Selling Propositions]]

We need to know:
- Who are your competitors?
- How do you differentiate from them?
- Are you able to be specific, precise and meaningful when explaining USP?
- Are you able to get interest? In touching to what's valuable to the customer?
- Can you create emotion with your product/service?
- How fast can yuo be imitated? What are the entry barriers?
	- Legal
	- Social
	- 

## Validation

It's the process of gathering evidence/learnings around problems/solutions through user testing, to make faster, informed, risked-less decision

- Define what process, assumption or step you will validate (problem,solution, end-user feasibility)
- With whom are you going to validate and why are them the most appropriate persons or groups to validate?
- Start from the most critical validations as they would act as a go-no-go for the upcoming stages (no pain no gain)
- Make sure that you frame the validation not as a marketing message (be open for different or more pressing problems). Don't try to convince people that something is a problem

- Do not launch survey. People do not respond to them.
- Don't ask about your idea, focus on their problems
- Avoid 3 Fs: Family, Friends, Fools
- Ask about behavior, not opinions.
- Who are we starting with? Why are they more critical?

Validation process:
- Assumption (see first what else similar has failed and why)
- Hypothesis/well educated guess (existing data/interviews)
- Validation outside the building (problem)
- Validate conceptualized solution (bare-bones MVP)
- Validation of solution (MVP, mock-ups of service or product)
- Validation of end-user opinion on the usability (simulation)
- Consider the appropriate early-adopters
