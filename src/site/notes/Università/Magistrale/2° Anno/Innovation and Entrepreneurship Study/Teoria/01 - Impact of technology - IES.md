# [[01.1 - Technology Delta and Barriers - IES]]

```table-of-contents
```

Steps:
- Introduction
- Penetration
- Mass market

## Introduction

```ad-Definizione
title: Technology Delta

How much better the new technology is compared to the one we are currently use.

```

The larger the technology delta is, the more we can encourage change.

Can it be estimated? Some things, yes, like performance. The impact, not really.

Timing parameters:
- Tech delta
- Barriers
- Dynamics
- Megatrends
- Tech trends

```ad-quote

Technology is the answer, but what was the question?
```

If new technology  is a missing piece in existing technology value chain, it might be extremely valuable.

## The hype cycle

Optimistic to pessimistic view. Then realistic, more based on facts.

Several steps:
- Innovation trigger
- Peak of inflated expectations
- Trough of disillusionment
- Slope of enlightenment
- Plateau of productivity - established technologies

Some technologies never make it into the curve but still have a huge potential.

The hypes of technologies are always debated and we can use these debates.

### EU TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL:

## Barriers to change and diffusion

Barriers can be found in many areas. The main ones are:
- legal framework
- Standardisation
- Trust
- Infrastructure
- Business model
- Critical mass
- Proof of concept
- Business ecosystem

### Legal framework

It's slow to change. We have to adapt to it.

### Standardisation

Standardisation.
Without it, many technologies have a hard time growing and developing.
### Trust

It's a matter of **perseption**. Takes a long time to build, and can be lost in a second.

### Infrastructure

Needed for many new technologies. The technology is good, but the surrounding infrastructure is missing

### Business model

There has to be value creation for every player.

### Critical mass

If critical mass is not reached, diffusion is not reached. If a technology needs a volume to exist, it could get stuck. For example, we all need to have phones, for phones to be useful.

### Proof of concept

If no one is ready to jump on board at early stages, there will never be new customers.

### Business ecosystem

Sometimes it takes time to build

# [[01.2 - Foresight - IES]]

```table-of-contents
```
We don't have much information about the future, so we build models to help us.

To build a model or theory, we use historical data to predict what could happen in the future

![Screenshot 2025-09-20 at 15.53.26.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/2%C2%B0%20Anno/Innovation%20and%20Entrepreneurship%20Study/Teoria/Allegati/Screenshot%202025-09-20%20at%2015.53.26.png)

The main issue is that we don't know what we don't know.

There are all possible futures, we don't know them. There are **plausible futures**: can happen. **Probable futures** and **Desired futures**.

![Screenshot 2025-09-20 at 15.55.38.png](/img/user/Universit%C3%A0/Magistrale/2%C2%B0%20Anno/Innovation%20and%20Entrepreneurship%20Study/Teoria/Allegati/Screenshot%202025-09-20%20at%2015.55.38.png)

### Back casting

We start from a desired future, and we work back how to get there. 

### Sequential back-casting

Not a desired future, but we look at where we are going with the current technology

What would the specific system in a 10-20 years perspective if we fully utilise the technology we have today?

- Create scenario
- Analyse scenario
- Define intermediate phase
- Describe phase
- Identify phase triggers
- Estimate timing
- Use the map

Demands on scenario
- Significant and difference to today
- Possible to communicate and understand
- Clear link a specific technology
- 10-20 years perspective

Develp the scenario
- 10-20 years perspective
- Today's technology fully utilised 
- Trends

We need to define the intermediate phases from the present and the future. So we ask what's needed to move from a phase to an other. These are called **triggers**.

Then we can estimate the timing of when each phase happens.
