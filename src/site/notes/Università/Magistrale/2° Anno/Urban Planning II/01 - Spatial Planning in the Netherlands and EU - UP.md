## The role of Spatial Planning

- Coordinates competing land uses in limited space
- Aligns public goals with private development
- Anticipates long-term needs: housing, mobility, environment
- Ensures legal certainty, fairness, and public interest
- Balances growth (or degrowth), equity, and sustainability

## Planning in the Netherlands history: 1901-2010

- **Housing as a core task** - from social housing to urban desnification
- **Shifting effort** - from spreading away from Randstad to concentrating in strong areas
- **Compact city ideal** - concentrate growth, protect green areas
- **State steering <-> decentralization** - shifting balance of responibilities
	- More authority to local municipalities
- **Sustainability & economy integrated** - linking housing, mobility, energy, ecology

## The backbone: Spatial Planning System (2011-2024)

Final goal:
Come up with a land use time
- Height
- width
- land use
- ...

**BUT!** Land-use plan may be drawn up by national or provincial government and imposed upon a municipality. For example if a certain area is considered of national interest.

**ALSO!** Important role of **water boards**: they are separate but crucial for flood safety and water management

### National policy strategy for infrastructure and spatial planning (2011)

Define a 3 steps process:
1. Determine where there is a regional **demand**
2. **Infill development** (including restructuring of existing locations) prior to greenfield development
3. **New multimodal locations** prior to car-dependent sites

There is no more a national plan, now there is just a **vision**, guidelines.

When does the national government intervene?
- **Competitiveness**: attracting talent and businesses
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring good multimodal mobility
- **Livability & safety**: Crating a healthy, safe living environment

Intervention occurs when:
- National interests are at stake
- International obligations must be met
- Issues cross provincial or national borders

## Environmental Planning

- Core urbanization principles:
- Development hierarchy
	- Accomodate within existing urban areas when feasible
	- If not possible, develop adjacent to urban areas with strong public transit
	- Otherwise, develop within urban agglomeration with transit connections
- Strategic implementation
	- Concentrate high density development near transportation hubs
	- Integrate multi-modal infrastructure
	- Balance density with green space preservation

### Environmental assesment evolution

1. Advanced start: Originally Europe's gold standard with strong safeguards
2. Growing Criticism: Became viewed as slow, costly, and overly bureaucratic
3. Political tension: Politicians saw delays, experts saw safeguards
4. Reform results: Simplification removed safeguards but didn't necessarily accelerate planning processes

Environment & Planning Act (Omgevingswet) (2024)
Planning in the Netherlands was long seen as slow, fragmented, and overly complex. The Omgevingswet marks a cultural shift: one law for a new way of working.
- Focus: integration; simplification; decentralization
- All government levels set environmental visions and rules for area development
- From 40+ separate laws (Land use, Infrastructure, Environment, Water) → one integrated framework
- All municipal land use plans will be replaced by **one environmental plan** → more cohesion
	- All environmental requirements are stated in the same plan/place
- Earlier citizen involvement in decisions
- Only **one permit** needed for complex projects
- Aligned with European directives
