- Does Generative AI provide performance improvements compared to working alone?
- Does it improve even when users don't have access to specific expertise
- Can it provide similar social engagement that we typically associate with humans

Groups with access to ChatGPT were much faster in achieving results and performed better on average.

It can be useful on cross-functional teams. AI allows less experienced employees to achieve performance levels that required previously human collaboration or supervision.

It allows humans to perform better in fields outside of their expertise.

### Human-autonomy-teams - level of automation

Human-autonomy-teams - HAT

Level of automation (LOA) describes degree of human involvement (1-10)

### Human-autonomy-teams - interdependence

A single team member is not able to complete a task alone without other humans or AI members.

Interdependence exists both for tasks and outcomes.

### HAT != Human teams

The mere belief of working with AI (even if not true) creates worse performance.

AI Machines become ineffective outside of their training context while we humans are extremely efficient in learning from small sets of data.

AI does not have any understanding. AI does not know the meaning of words. 

As humans we can start to implicitly understand each other, something not possible with AI.

AI is not proactive. It lacks initiative. It waits for a prompt.
