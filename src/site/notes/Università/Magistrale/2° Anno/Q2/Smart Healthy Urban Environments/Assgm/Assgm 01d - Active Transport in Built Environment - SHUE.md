**1d – Estimate models & write report (use template) on active transport in BE**

- the data of all walking tours will be combined into one database and made available
- Per evaluation topic: overall quality, comfort, safety and aesthetics you need to select 3 physical environmental characteristics that you think can explain the evaluation. Therefore, you first need to conduct literature research per topic to discuss what physical environmental factors (at least 3 per topic) can influence the evaluation of a walking tour. Based on the literature research you need to propose hypotheses. Subsequently, estimate 4 basic regression models (e.g., in SPSS) using the evaluations of the walking tour as the dependent variables (Overall quality, Comfort, Safety and Aesthetics) and the proposed physical environmental characteristics as independent variables, to test your hypotheses.  Then, present your results, and discuss the findings.

A template for the report is provided and includes the following sections:

Introduction report (500 words)

Literature research & Hypotheses (1000 words)

Regression Analysis & Results (1000 words)

Discussion (500 words)

For models 2 and 3, we expect all variables to have a positive effect on the target. For model 4, lights, artworks, and vegetation should have a positive effect, while traffic signals should have a negative one. Finally, we expect vegetation to have a positive effect on quality (model 1). According to the literature, we should expect the same from shops and bus stops. Nevertheless, we know that many participants recorded their impressions on walks that may not have had a specific purpose other than to complete an assignment, making the effects of shops and especially bus stops potentially negligible.
