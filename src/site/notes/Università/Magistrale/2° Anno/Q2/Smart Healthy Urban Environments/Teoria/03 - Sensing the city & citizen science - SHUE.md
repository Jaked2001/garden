# [[Università/Magistrale/2° Anno/Q2/Smart Healthy Urban Environments/Teoria/03 - Sensing the city & citizen science - SHUE\|03 - Sensing the city & citizen science - SHUE]]

```table-of-contents
```

At the beginning, smart cities focused on the technical aspects:
- Technology and infrastructure
- Management

The beneficiaries though should be the people: the **human** aspect.

## Citizen engagement in urban planning

- Crowdsourcing: citizens as sensors
- Distributed intelligence: citizens as basic interpreters
- Participatory science: participation in problem definition and data collection
- Citizen science: collaborative science - problem definition, data collection and analysis
