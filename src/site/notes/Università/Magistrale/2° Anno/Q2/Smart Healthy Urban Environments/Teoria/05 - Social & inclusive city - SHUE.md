## Concerns of community and social cohesion

Rapid urbanisation.

In 1800: 10% of EU lived in cities
In 1850: ??? 

Information age:
- Are local social relations still important in the information age
- Is social interaction becoming more superficial

### Increasing loneliness

[[SIRE]] commercials: showing the **unknowingly antisocial**. They try to make people aware of these issues: people that are alone without noticing it.

## Social cohesion

The glue that keeps society together

The ongoing integration of the individual behaviours in a social setting (here the neighbourhood).

National policies:
- Promoting civic participation
- ...???

Addressing social cohesion on a city scale:

### Local social ties

Neighbourhood ties are typically weak ties (for example, weaker than family ties)

But still important:
- Practical and instrumental support
- Rarely emotional support

Very important for aging population.

- Perceived attractiveness, character and quality are positevly related to social cohesion.
- Greenery helps improve perception


## Loneliness and the built environment

```ad-Definizione
title: Loneliness

**Loneliness** is a situation experienced by the individual as one where there is an unpleasant or inadmissible lack of (quality of) certain relationships.

```


- Emotional loneliness. lacking a close, emotional bond
- Social loneliness: fewer social contacts than desired
- Existential loneliness: fundamental separateness from others
- Trait loneliness: baseline measure of how lonely ...???
- State loneliness

Loneliness is a risk factor for both physical and mental health.

Influencing factors ([[Social ecological model\|Social ecological model]]):

- dwelling quality
- amenities
- urban density
	- 4 found people are more lonely in urban areas, 7 no effect
- mobility infrastructure
	- More lonely living on main road compared to residential street
	- walkability reduces loneliness
- green space
	- Quantity reduces loneliness...
- social environment
- social safety
- socioeconomic status
	- It's already correlated with the other factors

## Experiencing the built environment

How can we measure how people feel in a certain environment

Overall experience: place assignment
Momentary experience: affective appraisal and emptions. Metjods to measure...


### Tripartite model of place attachment

### Emotion theories

Emotions theories:
- Happiness
- Sadeness
- Fearr
- Disgust
- Anger
- Surprise

### Stimulus organism response theory

Complex relationship between humans and their environment can be captured in the stimulus-organism-response model

### SOR model -> modifying factors


### Experience sampling

ESM: Experience Sampling Method

Problems:
- People might not go to places they don't like; so we never have information about these places


## Inclusive cities

Inclusion is about is about ensuring everybody can participat in dali ???
