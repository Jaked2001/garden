Where can we still build? How do we keep our cities liveable? How do we stimulate active mobility? How do we optimise transit? How do we keep transit affordable (keep rural areas connected to the economic center without making people car dependent)? How to make our cities resilient? How to manage this transition?

How to create liveable and resilient cities for all?
