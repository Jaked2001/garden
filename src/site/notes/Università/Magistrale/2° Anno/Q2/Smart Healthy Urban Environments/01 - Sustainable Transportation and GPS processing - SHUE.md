Goals:
- Introducing the concepts Sustainable and Smarts
- Proving an overview of goals and means
- Focusing on active transportation and vital cities

## Sustainable Transportation and Smart Mobility

### Sustainable transportation

```ad-Definizione
title: Sustainable Transportation

**Sustainable transportation** fulfil needs of present population without comprising needs of future popoulations.

```

It aims at improving environmental health and quality of life for our society.

This is necessary because there is an increasing impact of transport on economy, society, and environment.

3 pillars to support sustainability:
- Environmental:
	- Reduce impact of human activities on the natural system that supports the community and the environment
- Social
	- Maintain healthy and socially equal community now and in the future
- Economical
	- Generate the money needed to support other two pillars: guarantee economic prosperity

Tools:
- [[Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan]]s (SUMPs)
	- Needed to create a sustainable urban transport system based on existing planning practice covering the mobility needs of individuals today and in the future

There are 12 objectives:

### Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)

Their goals is to enhance mobility, increase fuel efficiency, accessibility, operating efficiency, safety, and reduce pollution.

3 key elements are necessary:
- Sustainability
- Safety
- Smarteness

### Smart mobility

```ad-Definizione
title: Smart mobility

**Smartness** includes monitoring, controlling, and optimizing to bring in efficiency and bottom-line benefits as well as environmental improvements

```

Smart mobility objectives:
- Zero crashes --> safety
- Zero emissions --> Green
- Zero congestion --> Efficiency
- Zero exclusion --> Access

The smart mobility triad:
- G: Legal and Regulatory environment
- T: the magic
- CP: Plan, design, and implement

## The means

Smartness is mainly based on **acting on actual insight**.
- [[#Vehicle based]]
- [[#Infrastructure based]]
- [[#Organisation based]]

### Vehicle based

- Electric vehicles:
- User preferences
- Autonomous vehicles
- Cyclist safety
- Shared vehicles
- Overview

See slides...

Driving assistance:
- For safety
- For emission/fuel
- For time saving



### Infrastructure based

see slides.

### Organisation based

## Active transportation

Any form of human powered transportation, including walking, cycling, or rolling using a skateboard, in-line skates, wheelchair, or other wheel-based forms of human-powered transportation.

### Stimulators of Active Transportation

- Comfortable and safe infrastructure
	- Quality of pavement --> monitoring
	- Width of cycle paths and footpaths
	- Clarity of intersections
- Health environment
	- Emission rates --> monitoring
- Direct and coherent networks --> monitoring
