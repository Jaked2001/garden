### What is a digital twin?

No consensus yet!

- Base definition: a collection of urban data and model

- An UDT can be best characterised as a **container for models, data, and simulations**
- The goal is to achieve scalability in sensing an dmodeling physical and social spaces of cities by extending UDT capabilities to cover larger and more complex urnan environments without compromising....

- **Model integration**
- **Intersystem integration**
- **Cross disciplinary integration**
- **Cross-stakeholder integration**
- **Decision making integration**
