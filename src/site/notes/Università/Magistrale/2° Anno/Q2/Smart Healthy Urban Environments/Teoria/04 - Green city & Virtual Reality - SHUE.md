## Relevance of urban green

## Urban green definitions


```ad-Definizione
title: Urban greenspace
For al lnatural spaces in cities, mostly including water bodies

```

More accurate:

```ad-Definizione
title: Urban green

All natural areas and elements in cities:
- Urban green space
- Urban greenscape: small scale natural elements (like trees)


```

Urban green = urban green space + urban greenscape


| Urban green = | Urban green space | Urban greenscape |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Immersion     | high              | low              |
| Effort        | high              | low              |
| Frequency     | low               | high             |
| Intent        | high/yes          | low/no           |
Parks are fantastic but we don't visit them as often as the **urban greenscape**.

## Functions of urban green

lnadschappelijke inpassing: Using nature to hide ugly things.

- Hide artificial things
- Offers a meeting place: social
- Psychological
- Transport
- Production of: wood, food, oxygen
- Invites recreation
- Enhancing comfort (reduce heat island effect)
- Altering sound
	- Doesn't reduce noise level, but masks ugly sounds (highways)
- Water management
- Educational
- Ecological: green is habitat
- Pollution mitigation
- Financial?

## Main dilemma in urban green

- Main dilemma is on costs and benefits
	- Costs:
		- clear
		- in euros
	- Benefits
		- uncertain
		- "unmeasurable"
		- ont in euros
- Discrepancy in where costs and benefits land
	- City has cost
	- Benefits are for the people
		- They are not directly paying for those costs

## Researching urban green

Research is often on the (non-monetary) benefits

There needs to be some data collection.

Needs:
- Manipulate the urban (green) environment
- Treatment group
- Control group
- Ceteris Paribus (keep the rest the same)

How do I manipulate the urban environment?
- Adding, removing urban green impractical
- change in weather, light, etc.

We could use different locations with different conditions. There are still some issues:
- Different background (visual, sound, street activity, possibly weather)
- Different route to location

A possible solution is making use of technology: [[Virtual Reality|VR]]. It can't measure every aspect (temperature) but it keeps every condition consistent.
- Easy to change conditions
- Full control of different conditions

## Virtual and Augmented reality: VR/AR

1. Fictional vs existing
	- Fictional environment *prevents influence* of:
		- memory effect
		- place attachment
		- functional aspects
	- But, Validity of fictional environments? Can they be considered as valid as real environments?
2. Photo-reality vs computer generated graphics
	- Photo reality only possible with existing environments
	- Virtual environments can assist in researching
		- Existing environments
		- Previous environments
		- Future environments
		- Conceptual environments
		- A mix of all above


```ad-Definizione
title: VE, VR and AR
- **VE**: **Virtual environment**: a computer generated environment
- **VR**: **Virtual Reality**: a VE with interactivity
- **AR**: **Augmented Reality**: viewing the actual environment with VR elements added


```

### Potential issues

- Ethics
- Safety

Technical issues:
- We need a lot of computing power to simulate the environment: especially nature, that is very complex
	- solution: low poly or flat
