# [[Università/3° Anno/2° Semestre/Ecological Urbanism/06 - Mobility - EU\|06 - Mobility - EU]]


A city where it's easier to get around is more productive 
 
- Mobility: what we want
- Transportation: what we use to get mobility

### Mobility starts in Rome

Romans built the first highways
They also banned wheeled vehicles in the city. 

Transportation was to move from town to town.

[[Tabula Peutingeriana\|Tabula Peutingeriana]]

To live in Rome in the 16th century 2 things were necessary:
- Love for god
- **Own a carriage**

How does a city respond to mobility? 
If it's a compact city, no vehicles and we're really good at moving around.

Post war years: most wheels were either mass transit or bicycle.

### Pedestrian space in Rome today

The city is infested with cars.

There has been an explosion in motor vehicles.

### Auto sprawl syndrome

As you get more cars, waling becomes almost impossible.

The car has created more distance than it has bridged... and rendered bridging those distances without a car virtually impossible - [[Ivan Illich\|Ivan Illich]]


Plumbers are very important to our cities, and yet we don't ask plumbers to design our cities. Why do we let traffic engineers do?

### US vs Europe

Cars in America got bigger and a lot of people in US live in sprawling areas where you need a car to live.

In a european city, for the most part, fewer people own cars.

30% of our energy consumption comes from transportation.

36% of greenhous gas emissions in Rome come from transportation.


Why transportation doesn't work in Rome?
- Lack of Accountability
- Traffic


We're still thinking like in the past. We could use smaller metro trains with very high freqencies.

### 5 rings plan for Rome

[[Antonio Tamburrino\|Antonio Tamburrino]], [[Club of Rome\|Club of Rome]], Transportation consultant
He put together an alternative transit system for Rome.
5 rings:
- Light rail along the GRA
- Circular metro line
- Passeggiata del tevere - surface tram along the river

Making the all historical center totally car free.

Very small automated stations. Tunnels dug in a couple of weeks.
Getting off on the platform passengers would find elevetors right away to get on the surface.

### Future mobility

- Maglev
- Personal Rapid Transit (PRT)
- Hyperloop
- Mini metro, [[Perugia\|Perugia]]
- Metro C
	- It's cool it has museums


### How could mobility be improved in cities?
