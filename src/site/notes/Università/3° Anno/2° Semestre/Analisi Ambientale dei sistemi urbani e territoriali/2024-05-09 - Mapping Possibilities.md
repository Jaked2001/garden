1 big question: is planning, as a social justice project, possible in a capitalist world?

Posing the question on a theoretical level, has a negative answer.

It's not possibile in property owning, liberal capitalist democracy.

If asking the question in a more practical way: how to make the impossibile, possibile, in a small contest.


After the pHd I had become a slave of the political world.


If we spend our life trying to imitate someone, it cannot work in the long run.

I resigned from being a full processor because I thought I had lost my way.

Rethinging the way I had been thinking about planning: **the diversity project**.

- I started to challenge the official story of planning: how was planning complicit to the dark side of planning
	- communities opposing what was being planned
- What is knowledge in planning? what is missing from these accounts of what is knowledge in planning. I felt like we were excluding many stories. Only accounting for scientific data
- Difference that theory makes. We can't make resilient change with out a solid theory.
	- I was making an argument for inclusion. We don't see ourselves in these books.

> Interesting. Students couldn't see themselves in books. Theory wasn't accounting for the real world.

### Prima domanda

- You described your phd years as your worst years. Why was it so though. 

I was 21 and it was 1971 when I started the PHd. Before feminism.

I was historian, from humanities. Everyone was male. Everyone was economist or engineering.

### Seconda domanda

1992 Theory class crisis.

- She wanted to introduce in the class a conversation about race. Something happened. What?
