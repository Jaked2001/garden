# [[Università/3° Anno/01 - Water - EU\|01 - Water - EU]]



We can live w/o for no more than a few days. After ari, it's probably the most important element.

You can have too much water or too little water.
- Drought
- Flooding
They both cause problems

Overall in the planet quantity of water doesn't change. 
the problem is that there are places w/o and places with too much or it is polluted.

Another problem is extreme weather. 

- 97% of the Earth water is salt water
- 2% is frozen
- 1% only is available for dinking or irrigating

There is over 884 million people w/o access to safe water ([[WHO-UNICEF\|WHO-UNICEF]])

How do you ensure you have clean water?
- You have a source
- You have storage

Rome started out collecting rain water to have it for the dry season.

Many independent houses have a well.

## Transfer water


In ancient Rome:
Aqueduct --> principal reservoir --> Castellum (place that protect the water)

It the goes to:
- Public baths
- Pools and fountains
- Private homes

## Management

Roman baths were not only about water but also about heat.

Daily water consumption:
- 200 liters/person (North America)
- 100 liters/person (Europe)
- 10 liters/person (Developing world)

Every day, women and girls spend 200 million hours waling to collect water for their families. This happens in places without the appropriate infrastructure.



### Wetlands

Overflow areas for rivers: they are natural rainwater buffers.

### Getting water

- Desalinization: reduces the need for transportation
	- Uses natural evaporation and lightweight plastic
- Other solutions in combination with off-the-grid power sources such as PV

You could use excess energy to pump water up. Then use the water when you need it and even make energy from it.

### Water and green spaces

- Phytoremediation uses plants to clean water

#### Erosion

Excess water, like storms, washes away the soil. 
It's becoming a devastating problem (excess fertilizing, wrong crop rotation)

Soil erosion, sometime in the last century, began to **exceed new soil formation**.

## Drought

Not having water.


Water scarcity impacts 40% of the world's population, at-risk of being displaced as a result of drought
Rising temperatures caused by climate change are making already dry regions worse

We're getting more and more dry lands.

New weather patterns are turning water into a weapon
- new violent storms
- hurricanes
The lack of water is punishing certain people.

People are migrating away from deserts.

In 2018 17.2 million people in 144 countries and territories were newly displaced in the context of disasters within their own country
Displacement has been caused primarily by extreme weather events, especially storms (9.3 million) and cyclones,...???


## Learning from Rome

- Only world capital with a sustainable water system
	- More water is coming than it's needed
- Rome's water comes directly from natural springs without reservoirs
- Water is provided as a public service

Rome never really suffered from a drought.

## How do cities deal with hydrological emergencies

### Flooding

The most common of all natural hazards

#### Types of floods

- Flash floods
	- It rains a lot, there's no were for the rain to go
- River flooding
	- When excessive runoff from longer-lasting rainstorms and sometimes from melting snow causes a slower water-level rise over a larger area
- Tsunamis, coastal flooding, erosion

Generally we can predict water. It's become less predictable.

## Riverfront as a Resource

Waterfronts provide opportunities for vibrant urban form

- Blue infrastructure: waterfront that becomes a usable park area

Sometimes water is part of the city (Amsterdam, Venice)


Navigable rivers provide mobility but do not consume land.

The critical limits to growth may not be oil, land or money. It may be **water**
