# [[Universit√†/3¬∞ Anno/00 - Presentazione corso - EU\|00 - Presentazione corso - EU]]

Based on a workshop in Harvard: [[Universit√†/3¬∞ Anno/üè° Ecological Urbanism\|üè° Ecological Urbanism]]

- Rome Works
- e un altro


Working Assumptions:
- Limits make us SMARTER
	- When cities are limited we are forced to build them smarter
- Innovate as a last resort

## Language Pointers

- Limits make us smarter, working out makes you stronger
- Haste (= fretta) makes waste

## Growth is not a given

We assume growth is always good.

```ad-quote
title: [[Jane Jacobs\|Jane Jacobs]]
Expansion and development are two different things
```

You can develop something, making it better, without making it bigger

## Cities are Mankind's nature

```ad-quote
title: [[Paolo Soleri]]

To go to the countryside and return to the people and man-made things has left me with a real perspective on the city. It's probably one of the nicest things ever invented
```


## Everything is local somewhere

Everything that is done globally, has **local implications**.

## The Internet changes things


```ad-quote
title: [[William Mitchell]]

By the early 2000s, bits had returned from cyberspace. They had gone on location in the material world
```

Pollution is nothing but **resources** we're not harvesting. We allow them to disperse because we've been ignorant of their value. - [[R. Buckminster Fuller\|R. Buckminster Fuller]] (1895-1983)

# Cities

```ad-quote
title: [[Paolo Soleri]]

The essential problem is the present design of cities only a few stories high, stretching outward in unwieldy sprawl...
My solution is **urban implosion** rather than explosion.
```

# Rome a city of contradictions

7 themes of sustainable urbanism.

Rome as laboratory. We can use it as a case study.

[[Jane Jacobs]] - [[Dark Age Ahead\|Dark Age Ahead]]

```ad-Definizione
title: Sustainability
Meeting for the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

\- Defined by the [[world Commision on Envoirenment and Development]]

```

```ad-quote
title: [[The Club of Rome]], 1972

In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global worming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill... All these dangers are caused by human intervention.
```

### What does this mean for the city?

No **easy** design solutions
