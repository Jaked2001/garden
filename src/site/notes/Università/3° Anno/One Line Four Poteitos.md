# [[Università/3° Anno/One Line Four Poteitos\|One Line Four Poteitos]]


How will these new “cities” be made carbon neutral? How will the needs
of disease containment impact efforts to lower the environmental impact of city
policies and practices?

Each student in the group will address a discrete phenomenon to research and
present, but these components must be coordinated by the group to comprise a
unified presentation.

Presentations will be given orally in the classroom, in English, with the support of
digital slides (power point, etc.). Each student should speak for between 3 and 5
minutes.

Written reports must be between 1000-1500 words per student, clearly indicating
the author of each section. Illustrations and graphics should be clearly labeled and
all quotations must be credited to their source. Reports should be formatted A4
and submitted digitally in pdf format at the time of the presentation.
