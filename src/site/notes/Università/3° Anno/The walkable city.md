The worst thing we (Americans) invented is [[Urban Sprawl\|Urban Sprawl]].

He calls the car a time wasting and life threatening prosthetic device.


- 1/10 of the income in the **seventies**
- 1/5 of the income on transportation **now**

Since the seventies we doubled the roads and our spending on transportation.

Working families are spending more on transportation than on groceries(?): drive till you qualify.

[[Portland\|Portland]], [[Oregon\|Oregon]]:
is famous for 2 things:
- Transportation
- Homeless people: it has a huge homeless population

Most cities were growing a spare tire: they were getting bigger. In Portland they set a limit to growth. 

Most cities were removing parking and trees from roads to get more traffic through. Portland introduced the *skinny streets program*.

They spent 60 million dollars in bike infrastructure (in 30 years) half of what they spent in half a cloverleaf interchange they had to rebuild.

People in Portland drive 4 miles less than other cities. 11 min less. This adds up to 3% of total spending.

They spend a lot more on roof racks (= portapacchi auto).

Portland spends a lot more on recreation than most Americans.

They are spending a lot of it in their homes. 

Young educated people have been moving in Portland. They had a big increase in graduated millennials. 

The best economic strategy as a city is not to attract industries but to attract places where people they want to live.

Obesity in US used to be 1/10, now its 1/3.

There's no longer such a thing as a useful walk in our cities.

Environmental induced inactivity.
