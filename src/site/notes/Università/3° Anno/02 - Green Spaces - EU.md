# [[Università/3° Anno/02 - Green Spaces - EU\|02 - Green Spaces - EU]]



We are really talking about food.

Green gives us oxygen and food. 

Traditionally we've had an abundance of green spaces. Now we're consuming it so quickly that we need to bring it back into the city.

Green also means *farms*.

It's a question of having too much or too little. 
Out in the country you don't have the society and culture. In the city you have that but don't have clean air etc.

Since the beginning of cities we've always found a way to balance. Only in the last century we've shifted this balance. We get food from the other side of the world.

## Changing relations

In the beginning of people nature could be scary: they personified it, respected it and feared

Then, it was often seen as irrelevant, inevitable, ignored.

Then nature dominated, controlled, destroyed

Nature romanticized

Nature studied, respected


Nature is always considered "other".

```ad-quote

Land should be purchased nearby, so that the owner may visit it often... Whenever the chance offers, he should stay in the country...
- Columella (4-70 CE) De re rustica
```

ROMAN IDEA:
There should be equilibrium between OTIUM (Leisure) and NEGOTIUM (work)

MEDIOEVIL IDEA:
Siena has farms inside the walls. There is a balance between where people leave and where the food is made.

Land you can build on is more valuable than land you can grow food onto.

Farmland is essential for the city to live. The market economy does not reflect it.

RENAISSANCE:
mankind dominates and control nature.

Not balance but just-position.

We had the ideal country-side of the 1800s. Cities are useful but ugly. country side is beautiful but useless.
