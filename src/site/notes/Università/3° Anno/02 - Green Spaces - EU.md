# [[Università/3° Anno/02 - Green Spaces - EU\|02 - Green Spaces - EU]]



We are really talking about food.

Green gives us oxygen and food. 

Traditionally we've had an abundance of green spaces. Now we're consuming it so quickly that we need to bring it back into the city.

Green also means *farms*.

It's a question of having too much or too little. 
Out in the country you don't have the society and culture. In the city you have that but don't have clean air etc.

Since the beginning of cities we've always found a way to balance. Only in the last century we've shifted this balance. We get food from the other side of the world.

## Changing relations

In the beginning of people nature could be scary: they personified it, respected it and feared

Then, it was often seen as irrelevant, inevitable, ignored.

Then nature dominated, controlled, destroyed

Nature romanticized

Nature studied, respected


Nature is always considered "other".

```ad-quote

Land should be purchased nearby, so that the owner may visit it often... Whenever the chance offers, he should stay in the country...
- Columella (4-70 CE) De re rustica
```

ROMAN IDEA:
There should be equilibrium between OTIUM (Leisure) and NEGOTIUM (work)

MEDIOEVIL IDEA:
Siena has farms inside the walls. There is a balance between where people leave and where the food is made.

Land you can build on is more valuable than land you can grow food onto.

Farmland is essential for the city to live. The market economy does not reflect it.

RENAISSANCE:
mankind dominates and control nature.

Not balance but just-position.

We had the ideal country-side of the 1800s. Cities are useful but ugly. country side is beautiful but useless.

## Rome Master Plan

[[Piano regolatore di Roma\|Piano regolatore di Roma]]

Rome is the greenest city in Europe. It is very big and includes a lot of countryside.

Rome has 220 mq green/person vs New York that has only 13.5 mq green/person

## Types of green

There's different type of green:
- Spontaneous
- Farms
- Parks
- Gardens ([[Università/3° Anno/2° Semestre/Analisi Ambientale dei sistemi urbani e territoriali/04 - Gli orti urbani - ANASUT\|Orti urbani]])
- Vertical
- Tree-cover
- Green roofs

### Urban agricolture

[[Rome Sustainable Food Project\|Rome Sustainable Food Project]]. Association which operates in the American Academy of Rome's gardens.
They use what they grow in the kitchen.

### Green Walls

Sometimes the equivalent of green-washing. 
Often mostly there as eye-candy.

This was a french idea ([[Patrick Blanc\|Patrick Blanc]]).

### Green roofs

Use the roof better.

Rome has tonnes of opportunities for this. You can produce a lot of food and energy for that building.

### Urban Forestry

Tipo [[Bosco verticale\|Bosco verticale]] di [[Milano\|Milano]] by [[Stefano Boeri\|Stefano Boeri]]

Vertical forest is a model for sustainable residential building, a project for metropolitan reforestation...

examples:


If you wanna build a city from scratch and you want it to be a green city could you build a forest city?
