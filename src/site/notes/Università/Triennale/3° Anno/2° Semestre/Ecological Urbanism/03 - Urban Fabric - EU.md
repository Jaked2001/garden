# [[Università/Triennale/3° Anno/2° Semestre/Ecological Urbanism/03 - Urban Fabric - EU\|03 - Urban Fabric - EU]]



- Compact - High density
- Sprawl - Low density


Cities occupy 2% of earth's surface. Yet most of resources and produce of greenhouse gas emissions happen in the cities.

### Urban history

Global population has grown exponentially in the past 100 years. Urban population has grown even faster.

### Rise of the city

Cities started out as agricolture.

Agricolture and urbanism arise together about 10000 years ago.

Most pre-industrial cities had less than 2000 inhabitants, many engaged in farming nearby

Imperial capitals like Rome, Edo, Byzantium...


#### Pre-industrial cities

- They have walls, connected by roads and gates
- Narrow streets, carts confined to main arteries
- Public buildings and wealthy homes at center, poor on edges
- Neighborhoods or streets...???


#### Urban morphology

Major centers of industries and commerce. In the early 16th century 1/5 of Ducth and 1/4 of Tuscans lived in cities.

#### Megacities

In 1890 only 9 cities had more than 1 million people.

Megacities are the ones with more than 10 million people.

## What shapes a city?

- Response to geography, geology, hydrology
- Response to environment
- Ecological catastrophes - today cities are shaped by catastrophies
	- Fires
	- Floods
	- Earthquakes
	- Hurricanes
	- Pandemics
- Transformation due to political power
- Big events: Expo, Olympics
- Mobility - cities change because of connections
	- Automobiles - it unshaped the cities. They can go everywhere, so the city can be any shape

[[Personale/Contatti/Paolo Soleri\|Paolo Soleri]]: They literally transform the earth, turn farms into parking lots and waste...


Denser cities consume less fuel.

[[Drawdown\|Drawdown]] by [[Paul Hawken\|Paul Hawken]].
It talk about cities. We would blame cities for pollution. They realized that cities, if built correctly can be places places where human beings can have the lowest impact on the planet and be educated, creative and healthy.

- Sprawl cities tend to separate our activities like Live, Work, Play.
	- Single minded - everything has one goal
	- Hired security
		- Everyone leaves their homes at the same time
	- Motivated by profit
- Compact cities combine everything.
	- Open-minded
	- Natural security
	- Quality of life

On a regional scale, we can have a lot of compact cities connected by transit

If there is a compact cluster of compact cities you get a metropolis: you get neighborhood, each with its own identity, but very close by

[[Università/Triennale/3° Anno/2° Semestre/Ecological Urbanism/Jeff Speck\|Jeff Speck]] - [[Theory of Walkable Cities\|Theory of Walkable Cities]] - To have walkability you need 4 things. Walk has to. be
- Useful - meet some daily needs in daily life
- Feel safe
- Comfortable
- Interesting



## Compact city

- Mixture of functions sharing common space or in cose proximity
- Access to unspoiled landscape within waling distance of dense urban fabric
- Pedestrian-priority over motor vehicle use
- Strong community organization and participation in governance
- Cultural vitality, incubators for innovations
- Critical mass to support public transit

	- Not really a city

	- Separate the natural and the ecology and architecture (archology)

Urban regeneration vs. urban renewal vs Urban revitalization
- **Urban regeneration**
- **Urban renewal**: usually associated to tearing down and building back
- **Urban Revitalization**

### Urban Regeneration

## Urban fabric

The way we plan buildings and spaces in between, the way we house people and provide for their needs, all have a major impact on the future of the planet.



"Cities are mankind's nature" - 
we must rethink cities to play a positive ecological role.
