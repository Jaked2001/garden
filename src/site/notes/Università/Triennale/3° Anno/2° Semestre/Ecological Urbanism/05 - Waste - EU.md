```ad-quote

Waste is nothing but the RESOURCES we are not harvesting. We allow them to disperse because we've been ignorant of their value - Buckminster
```

Where does it all go?
- Humans generated 2.01 billion tons of solid waste in 2016
- By 2050, that could rise to ??? tons

It ends up in:
- Landfills - ?? %
- Incinerators - 11%
- Biological - 
- Recycling or composting- 46%

Reduce -> Reuse -> Recicle

Composting is a form of recycling.

Down-cycling: each time you use something it gets worse and worse.
Up-cycling:

It's hard to recycle everything. Sometimes you need more energy for recycling than it is worth.

The only thing that the romans threw away were amphoras.
Marble was burned to make a component of cement or in small pieces to make mosaics.

## The consumer economy and the birth of waste

Do we really always need new things?

With the industrial revolution we solved the problem of scarcity.

Planned obsolescence: making things low quality on purpose to sell more.

Worldwide waste generated per person per day is about 0.74 kg. From 0.11 to 4.54 kg.


High income countries account for 34% of the world's waste, despite being only 16% of the global populartion.

### Cradle to cradle

In biology we're familiar with the life cycle.
We need to look into the life cycle of our technical materia - Technical Nutrients

```ad-quote

Our concept of eco-effectinveness means working on the right things - on the right products and services and systems - instead of making wrokng things less bad. Once you are doing the right things, then doing them "right", with the help of efficiency among other tools, makes perfect sense. - [[William Mcdonough]]
