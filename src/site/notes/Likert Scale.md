# [[Likert Scale\|Likert Scale]]

A Likert scale is a rating scale used to measure survey participants' opinions, attitudes, motivations, and more. It uses a range of answer options ranging from one extreme attitude to another, sometimes including a moderate or neutral option. However, 4- to 7-point scales are the most popular.

So, what is a Likert scale survey question? Instead of asking a yes/no question like, "Do you like our product?", respondents rate their attitudes on a scale ranging from "donâ€™t like at all" to "like it a lot."
