# [[Lumen vs Lux\|Lumen vs Lux]]

[[Lux\|Lux]] and [[Lumen\|Lumen]] are two different measurements of luminous flux. 

[[Lumen\|Lumen]] is a measurement of the quantity of light through a unit sphere while [[Lux\|Lux]] is a measure relative to the illuminated plane area tangent to the sphere.

**1 lumen** on an area of $1\,\rm m^{2}$ equals **1 lux**.

**1 lumen** on an area of $1\,\rm cm^{2}$ equals **10 000 lux**.
