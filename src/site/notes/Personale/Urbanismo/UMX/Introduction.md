## Shared Mobility

```ad-Definizione
title: Shared Mobility

**Shared Mobility** can be defined as all transportation services that are shared among users.

This goes from public transport to taxis, car sharing, ride sharing and carpooling, micro-mobility sharing — such as bike or kick-scooter sharing —, and shuttle services.

```

Everything in the mobility sector where assets are shared:
Asset:
- Vehicles
- Infrastructure
- Drivers
- Public Transport

### Shared Economy

```ad-Definizione
title: Shared Economy

**Shared Economy** is an economic model defined as *peer-to-peer (P2P) based activity* of acquiring, providing, or sharing access to goods and services.

This interaction is often *facilitated by a community-based online platform*.

```



### Urbanisation

Shared Mobility was born as a necessity. One of the key factor is that **our cities are ceaselessly grwoing**.

More than 50% of the world's population lives in cities.

Cities cover only the 5% of the world's land mass but:
- Produce 70% of the global wealth
- Produce 70% of the global $\rm CO_{2}$ emissions
- Consume 80% of the world's resources

From now to the 2050, approximately *400 trillion* trips will take place.


This comes with significant impact:
- Congestion
- Safety
- Use of city space
- Greenhouse gas emission
- Pollution

This is why cities are restricting access to private vehicle users into the city centers.

These measures require a plan B. Alternative means of transportation should be developed: public transport, new mobility services (mainly shared) and **active mobility**.

Public transportation is not always available or feasible: today's mobility behaviours is quite flexible and PT may be not in the right place at the right time or considered unsafe.

This is where [[Personale/Urbanismo/UMX/Introduction#Shared Mobility\|#Shared Mobility]] comes into place. It fills a mobility gap between an insufficient public transport service and private car usage.

```ad-note
title: Osservazione

Some assets, especially cars, are heavily unused. It makes sense to share them.

```

### New generations, new preferences

New generations are often happy merely to **use** a product rather than to **own** it. Cars, for examples, are seen more and more as a means of transport rather than a status symbol as they were in the past.

On top of this comes a greater awareness around **climate change, clean energy and pollution** in cities. 

```ad-note
title: Osservazione

The average privately-owned car operates less than one hour per day and carries an average of 1.5 passengers or less?

```

### Connectivity
