```ad-Definizione
title: Bike track/path

A **bicycle track** is an *exclusive* bike facility, it is physically separated from motor traffic and distinct from the sidewalk. Cycle tracks provide a space that is intended to be exclusively or primarily used for cyclists. ([[Urban Bikeway Design Guide - NACTO\|Urban Bikeway Design Guide - NACTO]])

```

Other road users may cross the bike path but not ride along it.

Physical separation of some sort is needed.

## Where to use it

- Main roads with fast driving cars
- In presence of high cycling volumes
- Wide roads - They normally also have high volumes and speeds of car traffic

## Direction of bike paths

### One-way path

2 tracks, one on each side of the road

When to use:
- Always
	- In most cases this is preferable
- When there is commercial activity
### Two-way path

1 path that allows to move in both direction. 

When to use:
- When it saves time or distance - preventing crossing (for example on very wide roads)
- There's also a one-way path on the other side of the road
- Along waterbodies or parks

## Separation of bike paths from car lanes


There are in general 4 ways to separate bike paths from the rest of the roads:
- Light method
- Medium method
- Hard method
- Level method

### Light separation of bike paths

There is just a simple curb, not very high or wide

The distance between cyclists and drivers is very short. Preferred only on more local contexts

### Medium separation of bike paths

Wider and higher than [[Personale/Urbanismo/UMX/Designing the Cycling City - UMX/Note/02.3 - Separated Bike Lanes - DCC-UMX#Light separation of bike paths\|#Light separation of bike paths]] (meybe a fence)

### Hard separation of bike paths

Wide and very prominent physical separation between road and bike path allowing for trees and grass to be planted.

### Level separation of bike paths

This is similar to [[Personale/Urbanismo/UMX/Designing the Cycling City - UMX/Note/02.3 - Separated Bike Lanes - DCC-UMX#Light separation of bike paths\|#Light separation of bike paths]] but the path is raised from the road making the dinstiction clearer.

## Separation of bike paths from sidewalk

Always create a physical separation between bike paths and sidewalks:

## Width of the bike path

![Schermata 2025-02-10 alle 23.26.00.png](/img/user/Personale/Urbanismo/UMX/Designing%20the%20Cycling%20City%20-%20UMX/Note/Allegati/Schermata%202025-02-10%20alle%2023.26.00.png)

## Surface of the bike path

Asphalt is preferable since is smoother for cyclists

## Pros and Cons

- [p] Safety
