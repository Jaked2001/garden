### Effects on cars

People believe that removing driving lane increases traffic. Not true if rebalance with new modes of transportation.

Biggest weapon is **change mode share**.

Price per year of owining a car vs owning a bike:

| Car         | Bike      |
| ----------- | --------- |

Notice how much people do NOT experience **delays** when biking. Also it's **cheaper**.


## Personal vs societal gains

Finally, you should distinguish between personal gains and gains for society as a whole. In order to be effective, you should know what facts are relevant to the person you are speaking with. Policymakers may be interested in societal benefits: the big picture. A resident might want to know what cycling means for themself in their daily life.
