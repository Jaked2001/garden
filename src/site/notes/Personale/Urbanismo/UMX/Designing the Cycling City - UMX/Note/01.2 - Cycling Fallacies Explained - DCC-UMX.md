## Our roads are too narrow

Actually, where roads are narrow, is where space is more scarse. Here, is where we need to maximise the space and where cycling infrastructure is more needed.


## People with disabilities can't cycle

```ad-quote

We shouldn’t provide for cycling, as it disadvantages people with physical disabilities

```

Actually, is the opposite. Cycling space can be dedicated to all vehicles that not exactly fit in the existing infrastructure.

The issue is making sure that behaviour of people on the infrastructure doesn't impair people with reduced mobility.

## Everyone needs to share the road

```ad-quote

If everyone just shared the road nicely, there wouldn’t be a problem

```

Elephant in people space: Without the presence of [[traffic calming]], reasonable behaviour on car can only go so far. Also, the behaviour depends on the kind of environment. If it says go fast, people will go fast.

## People break the rules when biking

```ad-quote

People frequently break the rules of the road when cycling (ignoring red lights, etc.)

```

Why do cyclists and pedestrian have a reputation of breaking the rules. And why do they feel like doing so if they're the more vulnerable.

It depends on environment. When road design is poor, intentionally and carefully violating a traffic rule may be safer.

Most of the danger in breaking rules come from the cars, not the bikes. 

## Cycling causes danger to people

It's probably more inconvenience than danger. To solve this problem, we need attractive places to cycle separated from people walking.

There could be places where cohesistance between cyclists and pedestrians is impossible.

Sometimes though, in a transitioning phase, we have to decide between 2 bad options: share with cars or share with pedestrians.

### Cycleways are dangerous

For example, for people out on leisure rides. **Difference in speed** is a problem.

Fix on this seems to be considering design more carefully.

Ideally we want to make top level cycling infrastructure but it's not always possible.
