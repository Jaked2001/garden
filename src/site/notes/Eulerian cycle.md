# [[Eulerian cycle\|Eulerian cycle]]


```ad-Definizione
title: Eulerian cycle

An **Eulerian cycle** is any [[00 - Graph - MM#Cycle|cycle]] in a [[00 - Graph - MM|graph]] that visits each and every link (or edge) exactly once.

```

## Necessary condition for an Eulerian cycle

The following condition was proved by Euler.

```ad-Teo
title: Necessary condition for an Eulerian cycle

A necessary condition for the existance of an Eulerian cycle is that all nodes in the graph have an [[#Even degree]].
```

### Even degree

```ad-Definizione
title: Even degree nodes

A node has an **even degree** when it spans an even number of edges (links).
