```ad-Definizione
title: GBFS (General Bikeshare Feed Specification)
The **General Bikeshare Feed Specification**, known as GBFS, is the open data standard for shared mobility. GBFS makes real-time data feeds in a uniform format publicly available online, with an emphasis on findability. GBFS is intended to make information publicly available online; therefore information that is personally identifiable is not currently and will not become part of the core specification.
